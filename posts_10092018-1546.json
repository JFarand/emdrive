Freedom still eludes these prisoners, even in death. It hosts figures like Fred Carson and Taylor L. Odom, men who died while trying to escape. Their graves are marked with cracked head markers, eroding names and inmate numbers. It\u2019s their final resting place, sinking into the dry ocean of the Texas heat.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a cemetery whose importance is hidden in its history. Specifically, that of convict leasing. &nbsp;Convict-leasing was a system of chattel slavery enacted post civil war. The South lost its access to free labor and created in its stead, a cheap, unregulated labor market to sustain itself. Soon after its creation, African Americans, particularly men, were arrested for minor offenses like jaywalking or not following town and county curfews. <\/p>\n<p>Legal officers convicted these men of felonies then sent them to labor camps. The South found its new labor source. The Imperial Prison Farm story is one regarding Fort Bend County and the state of Texas at large collaborating to build a system of labor on the backs of prisoners. &nbsp;&nbsp;According to the historic marker in place, the private prison was founded in 1878 post civil war due to area plantation owners struggling to work the fields and the mill. The owners, years later, formed Sugar Land after the convict lease programs were financially successful. Soon after the state of Texas emulated this success across the state creating successful towns and areas of business and commerce based around the labor and revenue generated from prison labor. For Reginald Moore the steward of the Old Imperial Farm Cemetery he believes the city of Sugar Land , Fort Bend County and the State of Texas owe the men and women who are interned in this sunken prison. \u201cSweat equity\u2026 \u201che said &nbsp;These guys wrongfully incarcerated for trumped up charges and they have sweat equity in this land that they should be compensated for this. \u201c These people and their descendants should have some type of compensation, some type of apology, some of restitution, recognition and reparation of some sort for all the sweat equity they put in. They brought Texas out of a destitute situation, out of the Civil War and all the companies that benefited from the exploitation of these men and women . <\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/owlasylum.net\/img\/cross.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4694\"\/><figcaption><em>The Old Imperial Farm Cemetery<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Moore believes that the labor of the inmates should be compensated by the State of Texas Department of Corrections whose leasing of the workers to private entities and municipality rebuilt Texas and created billions of dollars in &nbsp;infrastructure and private construction. <\/p>\n<p>Moores battle to save the true history of Sugar Land and Fort Bend County has extended into the council chambers .

Her words are museum hallway. We are gently ushered into time machines touring a media landscape of age past. Zora rewards us with texture of that time&#8217;s popular literary mold.<\/p>\n<p>She shares with us a valuable insight. During that era, it had become worth a writer&#8217;s time in rent and mortgage payments to pay attention to slave narratives. Yet, as Zora so eloquently waxes her reader&#8217;s internal ear, these stories left out significant portrayals. Those first person portrayals of primary sources from inside US Slavery&#8217;s hulls.<\/p>\n<p>Her tour corrals us through much research. <a href=\"https:\/\/owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/zora-neale-hurston-plagiarize-barracoon\/\" target=\"_blank\">Some of which lays foundation for controversy.<\/a> In Ms. Zora&#8217;s defense, she plainly states in this introduction:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had met Cudjo Lewis for the first time in July 1927. I was sent by Dr. Franz Boas to get a firsthand report of the raid that had brought him to America and bondage, for Dr. Carter G. Woodson of the Journal of Negro History. I had talked with him in December of that same year and again in 1928. Thus, from Cudjo and from the records of the Mobile Historical Society, I had the story of the last load of slaves brought into the United States.<\/p>\n<p><cite>cf ibid<\/cite>\n<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Zora invites us through journey of horrors. Her recounting of flesh smuggler William Foster and his trio of fraternal cohorts, Jim Meaher, Tim Meaher, Burns Meaher does favor, not injustice, to those historians she chooses to trust her own reputation to. These nefarious traitors of humanity are given an undeserved heroic treatment simply by virtue of being subject of Ms. Zora&#8217;s sorcery.\n<\/p>\n<p>This trek through time winds us through perilous waters and mutiny into those bloody waters composing Gulf of Guinea. It is here that we watch Zora conjure tale of Afrikan royalty welcoming these Whyte foreigners hoping to kidnap and trade in bodies of Afrikan kin like family. Ms. Zora writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soon Captain Foster and his kegs of specie and trading goods were landed. \u201cSix stalwart blacks\u201d were delegated to meet him and conduct him into \u201cthe presence of a Prince of Dahomey,\u201d but he did not meet the king.<\/p>\n<p>Foster was borne in a hammock to the Prince, who received him seated on his stool of rank. He was gracious and hospitable, and had Foster shown \u201cthe sights of Whydah.\u201d He was surrounded by evidence of great wealth, and Foster was impressed. He was particularly struck by a large square enclosure filled with thousands of snakes, which he was told had been collected for ceremonial purposes.<\/p>\n<p>\n<cite>cf ibid<\/cite>\n<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Zora concludes our majestic exploration of disgust in human trade in Dahomey by reflecting on her book&#8217;s ultimate protagonist. Wrapping up our expedition of history, she documents her thoughts thusly: <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With these things already known to me, I once more sought the ancient house of the man called Cudjo. This singular man who says of himself, \u201cEdem etie ukum edem etie upar\u201d: The tree of two woods, literally, two trees that have grown together. One part ukum (mahogany) and one part upar (ebony). He means to say, \u201cPartly a free man, partly free.\u201d The only man on earth who has in his heart the memory of his African home; the horrors of a slave raid; the barracoon; the Lenten tones of slavery; and who has sixty-seven years of freedom in a foreign land behind him.<\/p>\n<p><cite>cf ibid<\/cite>\n<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All these words from the seller, but not one word from the sold.

Woodson. It is important to note that Zora\u2019s \u201cBarracoon\u201d is not a personal vendetta against continental Afrikans or Pan-Afrikanists. Her work was in part commissioned(read that as directed and funded) by Carter G. Woodson and his staff.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As stated in Plant\u2019s writing, citing Ms. Zora\u2019s introductory chapter of her \u201cBarracoon\u201d:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>From February to August of 1927, Hurston conducted fieldwork in Florida and Alabama under the direction of Franz Boas, her mentor, the renowned \u201cFather of American Anthropology.\u201d Boas had early on approached Woodson, the \u201cFather of Black History,\u201d about a fellowship for Hurston, in support of the research. In accordance with their arrangements, Hurston was to collect black folk materials for Boas and scout around for undiscovered black folk artists. In addition to the gathering of historical data for Woodson, she was also to collect Kossola\u2019s story.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Woodson supported Hurston\u2019s field research with a $1,400 fellowship. Half of the funds came from the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, an organization founded and directed by Woodson.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I add this above for sake of preventive maintenance. Preventive maintenance particularly of arguments that have been formed as reaction to accounts documented by Zora Neale Hurston. Ms. Zora documents a detailed recounting of Cudjo Lewis\u2019s last experiences as a captive of Dahomean royalty.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In this recounting, Mr. Cudjo discusses how Dahomean leaders and warriors destroyed his hometown. Mr. Cudjo relays how his own family&#8217;s leader had his head cut off and worn as decoration. Yet, as this article\u2019s click bait-y title suggests, this is not my main topic.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Plant continues her discussion of how this book came to existence as she notes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026in the October 1927 issue of the Journal\u2026he[Woodson] published Hurston\u2019s Kossola interview as \u201cCudjo\u2019s Own Story of the Last African Slaver.\u201d6 A footnote at the beginning of the article stated that as \u201can investigator of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History,\u201d Zora Neale Hurston had traveled to Mobile to interview Lewis, \u201cthe only survivor of this last cargo.\u201d The note states further, \u201cShe made some use, too, of the Voyage of Clotilde and other records of the Mobile Historical Society.\u201d7 In reality, Hurston made more than a little use of the society\u2019s records. And though part of the article was \u201ca first-hand report,\u201d the larger portion of the article was secondhand information drawn from Emma Langdon Roche\u2019s Historic Sketches of the South (1914). Emma Roche was a writer, artist, and farmer born in Alabama in 1878. Her book is an account of the origins of slavery in America, couched in proslavery tenets and paternalistic perspectives.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite><\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Plant furthers her account of Zora\u2019s usage of Roche\u2019s work, offering a cogent enough explanation for Zora\u2019s oversight. That oversight being not including a citation for Roche\u2019s work. There is actually nothing to see here, though.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As stated, Woodson, a premier scholar commissioned Zora to seek out peer reviewed accounts of what might be USA\u2019s last slave smuggling aboard the Clotilda. Further, Ms. Zora\u2019s usage of Roche\u2019s work is only utilized in her introductory chapter. This information aids in verify Mr. Cudjo\u2019s words, but in no way does it form even a foundational presence in Zora\u2019s contribution.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Zora Neal Hurston\u2019s first(finally?) published edition of &#8216;Barracoon: The Story of the Last &#8220;Black Cargo&#8221;&#8216;, Deborah G.

(Cf. SITD \u2013 Page 77)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Within Dr. Jared A. Ball\u2019s I Mix What I Like: A Mixtape Manifesto, he gives readers a deeply Pan Afrikan-centered analysis of Hip Hop as it combats subjectivity due to being made by constituencies of Black folks undergoing \u201cInternal Colonialism\u201d in America, in which he theorizes to a T. (Cf. IMWIL \u2013 Page 14)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All the quotes from the books cited above discuss Hip Hop (to some degree) and it\u2019s communicative apparatus know as rap music in ways I appreciate and ways I cannot fully support. What they all do well is situate Black maleness into a space of subjection which is rightful the institutional-material atmosphere many of us reside in. They each address Black male MC\u2019s egalitarian role that they play in relation to their respective communities and clans, but to varying degrees. What is missing from one of these texts is often visible in others. For example where Ball gives space to theorization of Hip Hop and its audiences and influencers through a theme focusing on exploitation in a colonial fashion, Rose forces us to consider the reality through her vantage point of the sociopolitical scene encasing Hip Hop, which is appreciated because she is one of the first female cultural critic to map out why Rap music is like it is today. Spence does something similar to Rose albeit mainly to establish Hip Hop as an arbiter of neoliberal governmentality and politics using tests, surveys, and data.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although all three texts discuss neoliberal logic\u2019s internal and external effect on Black populations, they don\u2019t call explicitly call it \u201cracial neoliberalism\u201d or consider Black males to be neoliberalized Post-humans (Adams Burten, 2017). Though they all understand the vulnerability of Black people generally, only Dr. Spence and Dr. Rose make arguments about Black males as if they occupy an exceptional space where they can control they destiny through tactics of neoliberalism\u2014entrepreneurial thinking, claiming and showing expertise, and uplift logic that has no real understanding of the material realities influencing its sway. Dr. Ball actually talks about Black males in his book less than Dr. Spence and Dr. Rose and still has a more progressive outlook in terms of the point of this article.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Neoliberalism is many things, but the aspect that I will focus on is its ability to create value-based markets and apply those market systems to the world\u2019s social hierarchies. In laymen\u2019s terms\u2026Common sense was replaced by neoliberal thought\u2026it became commonplace to tell people that look like me it\u2019s their behavior\u2019s fault that the system penalizes them. It became commonplace to suggest that more businesses accompanied by financial literacy philosophy in Black communities where more than half the residency makes less than 40k\/year (and have a median wealth of $1700) would reverse Black economic turmoil. It functions like propagandized consciousness predicated on the accumulation of capital by any means necessary. And you know what? It doesn\u2019t surprise me that a people whose ancestors were considered capital investment would flaunt any slight bit of capital they may come across today. Black communities have had a pro-capitalist sway without fully being capitalists at relevant measures due to annexation from the US financial realm. Being that Hip Hop, and by extension, Rap music, has aided and abetted neoliberalism\u2019s firm grip on Black consciousness (unconsciousness?), it reaffirms its teleological logics\u2014proving Neoliberalism\u2019s point basically\u2026<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But the last time I checked, if my understanding of the intellectual bravado put forth by Critical Race Studies serves me and my memory right, Blacks\/Africans are more or less subjugated wherever we preside. So\u2026why do political discussions do so bad with articulating that fact for US Black people, entirely, and, US Black males in particular? The obvious answer is in the first sentence although the nuance gets deeper. Hip Hop, even as an insurgent medium for autonomous creativity, is no outlier to this politically induced dysfunction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve been manipulated.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Colonized.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Massacred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mischaracterized.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Then, masqueraded in our delusions of self.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hip Hop as a social vehicle for Black cultural expression has assisted in the explanation of such happenings to Black people. So\u2026no need to delve too deep into it, except to always remember that politics is \u201cprofessionalized\u201d war. But our only issue is that, Hip Hop\u2019s oral tradition of Rap music could be described as almost anything other than \u201cprofessional\u201d\u2014its intricate idiosyncrasies dealing with the genre\u2019s capacity to generate respectability politics through dissemination, notwithstanding. Rap can\u2019t seem to escape neoliberalism (not by itself, at least\u2026) because it\u2019s a cultural product of Black people. The suppressive powers that be\u2122 like it that way though and it\u2019s shown by which shows and people they give green lights to.

As sunshine spreads, silently showing areas of a living room or study window that still need cleaning, a social media feed, or timeline, is scrolled for &#8220;a reason&#8221;. From an opening in same said window, calm and crisp currents of air are deeply inhaled while cursory plans of activism in areas distant from present locale are imagined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I jest. But, as noted by some wise person once, there is admixture of truth somewhere in there, as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Murder is grave, and yet, ironically, or quite possibly, inevitably, after watching video after video of murder or hearing about them in graphic detail, there has been numbing that reflects a mature apathy. Apathy only reads as unhealthy when one simply scrolls past. Apathy becomes almost instinctive when one is addicted to awareness of a mediated sort.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A murder as grisly as Darren Seals&#8217;s murder demands that type of apathy scholarly folk in western nations refer to as &#8220;objective&#8221;. It is an apathy that pretends at balanced considerations of context. It is an apathy attempting to weigh Darren&#8217;s associations&#8211;aggressors and allies, actions&#8211;on and offline(if a &#8220;line&#8221; even still exists), and accomplishments. His is life lived loud enough to question whether his running with a &#8220;rough crowd&#8221; or rebelling against a rough State sanctioned its murder. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Darren&#8217;s was an abbreviated existence. From that privileged vantage point of four decades of breathing and bleeding in a Black and male body, my more reflective response is one that leans heavily on my expertise in apology and timely understandings. This is a skill set and benefit Darren&#8217;s age, race, and sex did not afford him.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I was not a friend, nor fan, of Darren Seals during his brief time with us. I appreciated his candor and dedication to a more authentic narrative of what &#8220;activism&#8221; looked and felt like prior to former negro in chief Obeezy made statements days later regarding Ferguson&#8217;s uprising that lead to a global influx of travelers to our shared nativity. I understood that Darren represented a voice that had been silenced by microphones and speakers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Darren Seals became for me a symbol of that difference between &#8220;hands up, don&#8217;t shoot&#8221; as a weapon, a taunt towards an active and armed invasive police presence versus &#8220;hands up, don&#8217;t shoot&#8221; as a sign of submission, of obsequious media supplication. Darren Seals signified those elements of that incipient local Mike Brown Forever Movement that could not be branded as leaders by celebrities and journalists because he could not be branded for a national and global media market.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>That Micro&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<section class=\"quotes\">\n<blockquote><p>\n<center><\/p>\n<p>My homie got shot, he&#8217;s a goner, Black<br \/>\nSt. Louis niggaz want they corner back<br \/>\nShootin&#8217; in snowy weather<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s illegal business,<br \/>\nNiggaz still can&#8217;t stick together&#8230;<br \/>\n<cite>&#8220;My Summer Vacation,&#8221; Ice Cube, <u>Death Certificate<\/u>, (1991)<\/cite><\/p>\n<p><\/center><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/section>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In a speech DeRay Mckesson once gave to his alma mater, he stated that one does not have to be close to a trauma to help. I disagree. Deray represented distance from a trauma while building a professional resume off of same said trauma. Darren Seals represented that trauma. Darren Seals is what a wound sounds like before those bandages are applied.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Darren Seals did not have a large Twitter following. His involvement was prior to Former Head of State Barry Obeezy&#8217;s announcement that Ferguson\/St. Louis, Mo was fair territory for media invasion. After that announcement, three days after Mike Brown was assassinated, those of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton ilk began to descend on that town. Those with media awareness had driven into Ferguson with an understanding taught by Trayvon&#8217;s assassination that a social media presence could be built from recording and updating about a murdered Black Male body. I say Black Male because me &#038; coach learned that updating about murdered Black Female bodies(like Aiyana Stanley-Jones or Rekia Boyd) will only get you ire. But I have digressed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is an importance to micro or local constituency that will cause my own authority to be questioned. Having a large Twitter following does have value, that value just does not translate well into government politics where social justice battles are won. That is not me saying only way to alleviate social justice grievances is by voting or waiting on some judge to mandate egalitarianism. In order to combat a militarized police state and its prized propertied class, one must be involved on a local level with their organizing and surveying of terrain. Once again, there is a value in audience, but it needs to be understood that audience is not a constituency. There is a value in mediated distance, but that distance can be a hindrance to effectively resolving social political grievance at a local level. Micro concerns need micro work, not just meta or macro work. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mike Mike Brown, whose senseless murder brought so many young, brave, but voiceless citizens into public social responsibility, was probably not a &#8220;perfect&#8221; victim. It should stand to reason that those willing to show up without thought for their safety or expectation of RT&#8217;s or an exponential increase in follower counts&#8211; that is, Mike&#8217;s neighbors and immediate peers&#8211; were also not &#8220;perfect&#8221; in that same sense. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I cannot defend Darren for smacking Deray one fateful and tense night of early 2015. Although, when it came to my attention, I chuckled. It was an admittedly immature response to ill-timed bit of territoriality. Beyond that emblem of native first response unit, organized or otherwise, was youth seeking displaced honor. I refuse to defend Darren or give him any stripes for physically attacking Mr. McKesson, or for his botched attempt at a getaway that almost injured a few of my loved ones that also were out that night. Yet, even my pretentious apathy cannot bear to feign ignorance of impetus that possibly drove that behavior. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As stated, I was not a fan of Darren Seals due to our various circles colliding at certain points. However, someone I worked closely with had very balanced and fair words regarding Darren. I worked with Bob Hudgins on his digital campaign during both his legendary runs in Ferguson for local government. His understanding of personalities and events are forged from a daily pavement pounding and glad handing of locals he also calls his neighbors. He wrote a piece in honor of Darren that I will repost here in its entirety:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<section class=\"quotes\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>KING D AND ME<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I told a friend recently that Prince would die if he knew how he died. The visionary musician from Minneapolis was famous for a lot of things, one of them being a strict teetotaler who was drug-free. The 57-year-old was self-medicating hip pain with the powerful synthetic narcotic Fentanyl, and he died from an unintentional overdose in April.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The same could be said for Darren \u201cKing D\u201d Seals, who was shot in the head and left to burn in his Jeep this week in North St. Louis County, near the Mississippi River. The 29-year-old auto worker, rapper, and conscientious activist would shit his pants if he knew the facts surrounding his demise. He was a deeply proud man, and the image of him being offed in his car haunts the minds of those who knew and cared about him.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It was a particularly brutal murder. One gets the sense that whoever did it understood that he was doing more than killing a body: he figuratively poked all those in the eye who looked up to this fiercely proud man who wished to unify the oppressed of his home town against the forces keeping them down.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>D was taut and wiry, with a lantern jaw and wide-set, almond eyes. He was a beautiful man, and his presence and charisma added extra tension to the swirling controversies at which he was the center.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The disparity between his online persona and his in-person impression was stark. We were not close, but I spoke with him a handful of times and he couldn\u2019t have been more friendly. I have been known to be wrong about people, but I got the feeling that he was a good guy, that he was genuine. He didn\u2019t have time to be fake.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I saw him at Blueberry Hill in early 2015 with his girlfriend, Naomi. I took a couple pictures. Here\u2019s one:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/owlasylum.net\/img\/posts\/darren_seals\/oa_darren_seals.png\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\"><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Darren projected the conventionally masculine hardness he thought his environment required. Shot six times in the summer of 2013, he vowed to work to reduce the violence within his community and the violence directed at his community by the police.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He was compassionate and generous\u2013a first day protester who befriended and consoled Mike Brown\u2019s mother, Lezley McSpadden; co-founded Hands Up United, an organizational response to the uprising; and gave his time and money to those in need in Canfield Apartments, where the killing occurred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He could also be viciously misogynistic, homophobic, and prone to conspiracy thinking. In the spring of 2015 he blasted a segment of protesters he disagreed with on Facebook, saying, \u201c\u2026Fuck those people with a aids dick\u2026Everybody that\u2019s left standing needs to use this next check to do something constructive with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Darren had difficulty recognizing the contributions of those he didn\u2019t see eye to eye with, and he projected onto others some of the things he was doing, like ingratiating himself with visiting dignitaries.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The call on the street \u201cduring Ferguson\u201d was \u201cLet\u2019s get free!\u201d What some in the movement couldn\u2019t process was that \u201cLet\u2019s get free\u201d means different things to different people. Some understood that call to be multi-tiered. Also, some groups wanted different things to result from the uprising, such as getting the municipal courts off of citizens\u2019 backs. Transgender folk demanded their human dignity and the right to live without harassment. Gay black women, many of whom were (are) our best leaders, expected the respect due to them for their heroic efforts. These were added on top of the immediate, pressing concern, which was: Stop killing us.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>King D and his cohorts believed the revolution could be led from a central office directed by straight men. Another faction, mainly led by feminist lesbians said \u201cLook at the power and influence we wield; the masses are with us.\u201d Both sides came to reject each other. There was a third strand of thought comprised of the pragmatists, the grunts of the movement, (some figures moved back and forth between the groups), who said \u201cAll Black Lives Matter\u201d\u2013let us all come together to be subsumed under this rubric, with a laser focus and undiluted energy to get this thing done, then we can move on to the other matters. Or, to put it another way, let\u2019s get back to the way it was at the beginning, when we were all unified. This was a romantic, stuck-in-amber image. This latter group loathed the so-called \u201corgs\u201d, the professional organizers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But the beginning was spontaneous and disorganized. We needed to organize to continue to mold the conditions for success and to keep the momentum going. These strands of thought have not been coherently woven together. The groups have yet to reconcile their differences.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>King D\u2019s murder reminded us all of these unresolved differences, the contradictions in the movement. Make no mistake, the community of conscience received the news of his death as an affront to the entire movement, as an attack on its goals. This one feels personal. It is a true inflection point in this ongoing story.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Revolutions are messy. The fringes cannot be contained. All of the above\u2019s efforts were necessary, but not sufficient. We needed to persuade more white people that we were on the right track.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We have been partially successful. There is a new reality in the land. More Americans are woke, never to return to slumber. It started here, in Ferguson. Of that, I am very proud.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I ran for Ferguson City Council in the middle of the ferment. I ran explicitly as a protest candidate. Further, I am white, which we thought might be my ace in the hole to attract enough white voters to get over the top. The white power structure of Ferguson dominates my ward.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I did not win. The white male managing editor of the black weekly the St. Louis American, Chris King, told me, \u201cIf they didn\u2019t come out and they didn\u2019t come out for you, they weren\u2019t your voters.\u201d I get it intellectually, but it is a facile reading of the peculiar, albeit typical, history of Ferguson, MO. I received the third-highest vote total in a contested race against the former two-time mayor and head of \u201cI Love Ferguson\u201d, Brian Fletcher, since deceased. I got more votes than most of the people on the city council now. I could have won in 2015 with more help, the right help. Our lack of organization hurt the movement right here, when we could have seized a majority on the Council. My inability to ascend to the Ferguson City Council affects policy to this day, as the newcomers either openly back the mayor, James Knowles, or have been co-opted into his designs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The monitor, the Department of Justice, and leaders of the City met with Federal judge Catherine Perry this week. Ferguson is behind on most of the deadlines within the consent decree. However, the judge patted Ferguson on the back, and said \u201cKeep at it.\u201d That\u2019s not good enough. We need to keep the pressure on the leadership.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each hour that passes the murder case gets colder. The police did not appear to do a tidy, thorough investigation of the crime scene. Shell casings and one of the doors to his vehicle were left at the location. The Major Case Squad was not assigned to this one. The community desperately needs to know who did this, and why. Conspiracy theories are already rampant, and it is conceivable that protests could be waged against whatever the police find. We need answers, good ones, now.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We may hope that King D\u2019s legacy serves to help repair the disunity in the movement, that it might lead to greater focus, purpose, and success. Hope is a mushy concept. Hope requires fuel, it needs something to power and drive it. It was there the whole time, and it was King D\u2019s real creed: Get out there and do something. That message applies to everyone, and cannot die.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Goodbye, D.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/onthetopstep.com\/2016\/09\/09\/king-d-and-me\/\" target=\"_blank\"> Bob Hudgins (September 9, 2016)<\/a><\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/section>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>That Macro&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Erica Caines&#8217;s prescience and political insights have gone underappreciated vis-a-vis this growing body of Ferguson Unrest analysis. I still call her &#8220;Oracle&#8221;. It was she that cautioned me of my own naivet\u00e9 while meeting celebrated figures. While she probably continues to believe I am naive in my choices of associates, I am indebted to her perspectives. Many of my better judgment calls during all of this were guided by something she typed in a direct message. Many unsung persons have yet to receive their due.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That being stated, I cannot in good conscience extend my vote of faith for Darren&#8217;s ancestral commemoration here without a number of obvious caveats. From Tribe X&#8217;s historical occupation of St. Louis University as opening salvo, to that extremely under reviewed October weekend of disruption of all of St. Louis in 2014 as a whole. If Darren must be ancestral emblem of micro\/local public grievance, it should be noted that dead people can honor their own, but living people must honor those living as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of Darren&#8217;s many concerns with local activism as it became distant from those traumatic events local to Canfield Green Apartments was activists being paid, or not being paid an agreed upon compensation, as it turned out. While Darren Seals is being commemorated as a citizen that needs not profit motivation or media attention to fulfill civil obligations, other activists had\/have financial obligations. Many heroic youths that have cemented in an under celebrated history creative and intrepid political activity were scorned when they mentioned on Twitter their homelessness or condition of destitution. While some have gone on to red carpets and stages of higher status in this society, those they left back still need assistance. I not only marched with Deray and Netta, I also marched with Joshua Williams.

By examining strengths and limitations of some existing theories and concepts within Black Studies, the goal of this examination becomes to more effectively address the problems of the epistemic convergence Eurocentrism structurally imposes on Afrikan people seeking liberation. Through an examination of how the cultural logic of racism\/white supremacy has determined the shape and character of institutions within the United States, this work will argue that the most constructive political disposition for an Afrocentrist to take is one of separatist nationalism. The argument being made is that this ideological component is a necessary catalyst to produce Afrocentric scholarship that has optimal functional utility toward the goal of achieving sustainable liberation for Afrikan people from the Maafa.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Keywords:

style=\"text-align: center\"><em>&#8220;Thus imperialism, like the prehistoric hunter, first killed the being spiritually and culturally, before trying to eliminate it physically. The negation of the history and intellectual accomplishments of Black Africans was cultural, mental murder, which preceded and paved the way for their genocide here and there in the world&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>~ Cheikh Anta Diop<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The imperative of European Imperialism then colonialism throughout Afrika and the rest of the world has deliberately resulted in a global order of widespread systemic anti-blackness\/anti-Afrikanness to advance the interests of whiteness and to develop a modern world for white people on the exploited backs of Afrikan people with plundered mineral resources from the Afrikan continent. The military and intelligence apparatuses of Western imperial states have continually extended from the state to local levels within their own countries and abroad to insulate a global system of Pan-European and white racial domination which inevitably has perpetuated and reproduced the damages inflicted upon Afrikan peoples of the world throughout the Maafa. To sustain this global order, Europeans have imposed Eurocentric miseducation upon diasporic Afrikans internally within their own states and externally upon continental Afrikans in Afrika via colonialism. These institutions of Eurocentric miseducation have endured national liberation struggles throughout the Afrikan continent and shifts in varying political climates in most if not all places where Afrikan people are throughout the Afrikan diaspora resulting in the predominance of contemporary (neo)coloniality of today across the Afrikan world.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">One of the most devastating and persisting effects of the Maafa on most Afrikan people is the infliction of an inferiority complex upon them, which causes them to assume the superiority of whites. Through processes of enslavement, enslaved Afrikans were made to think of themselves as dependent on their European enslavers through vicious attacks of psychological, cultural, and physical violence. Because of the diversity of violence perpetually inflicted upon Afrikan people by an interconnected seemingly totalizing system of white supremacist institutions, Afrikan people have been culturally dislocated and therein politically disoriented. Afrikan people have continuously resisted the Eurasian custodians of the Maafa since their initial antagonisms and failed incursions into Afrika since Antiquity, until their eventual and perpetual imposition upon Afrikan people in the Afrikan continent and throughout the world today.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">One of the most significant challenges to the conceptual domination of Eurocentrism that has accompanied the intellectual imperialism of racism\/white supremacy has been the development of Afrocentricity, which was produced by Dr. Molefi Kete Asante. Dr. Asante articulates Afrocentricity as &#8220;a consciousness, quality of thought, mode of thought, mode of analysis, and an actionable perspective where Africans seek, from agency, to assert subject place within the context of African history.&#8221; Afrocentricity is such a revolutionary challenge to the system of white racial supremacy because it methodologically decolonizes, or rather re-Afrikanizes the minds of Afrikan intellectuals that would otherwise accept deeper levels of European cultural assumptions as neutral. This unconscious perpetuation has often advanced the European intellectual form of colonization, which intellectually &#8220;lynches&#8221; or &#8220;decapitates&#8221; many Afrika<span style=\"color:black\">ns. <\/span>This removes the desire to and the understanding for why we must remove ourselves totally from the influence of European cultural hegemony. By understanding ourselves as subjects, Afrikans can then act within their own cultural values and political interests to pursue liberation for themselves more effectively with conceptual clarity from discursive Eurocentric ideas grounded in the history of Europeans and\/or Eurocentric interpretations of any history. Afrocentricity defies the conventions set in place by racists by rejecting the alleged neutrality of European culture and insisting upon the historiographic centering of the Afrikan as subject within their own history producing clarity of consciousness for historical actors in the present moment. These are the first hugely fundamental steps for Afrikan intellectuals to take if they are ever to liberate themselves from the European cultural matrix.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">One of the key aspects of the Afrocentric Paradigm is the functional aspect which has been insisted upon by Dr. Ama Mazama and as she articulates:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 36pt\">&#8220;Afrocentricity\u2026must prove able to activate our consciousness, to open our heart in such a way that membership in the Eurocentric plantation is no longer appealing or an option. Although it is incorrect and unfortunate that many have attempted to reduce Afrocentricity to an intellectual exercise, confusing it with the creation of a shallow discursive space with no serious and real implications for one&#8217;s life choices, the lives of many others who have been deeply touch by Afrocentricity is indeed a true paradigm for African liberation.&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This intellectual maroonage off of the conceptual Eurocentric plantation is representative of why the functional aspect of the Afrocentric Paradigm is its most important component. The institutional reinforcement of these conceptual spaces is inseparable from the material realities determined by conflicting historical processes where Europeans have and continue to reproduce their systems of white racial domination and where Afrikans have perpetually struggled to produce survivable terms for themselves upon which they can live, given the perpetual attacks of the Maafa. Separate material spaces are and should be the objective for Afrikans seeking autonomy outside of white domination. The significance of Afrocentric intellectual production cannot purely be an intellectually exercise for us as though we are at an ancient Greek symposium, but needs to ultimately be applicable to a given aspect of our contemporary struggle for Afrikan liberation from white racial domination. Any corrective to a problem that is interrogated by an Afrocentrist must be practical for application outside of any philosophical circumstance.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Dr. Mazama&#8217;s understanding of Afrocentricity is that &#8220;it cannot and must not be reduced to an epistemological project.&#8221; Afrocentric thinkers have neither the luxury or political necessity for purely abstract and ungrounded philosophical engagements as the Maafa continues to rampage throughout the world. The implication of this is profound because it means that an Afrocentric perspective cannot be simply reduced to an epistemological standpoint because Afrocentricity cannot be reduced to purely a philosophical project. To maximize the functionality of Afrocentric praxis, a separatist disposition must be taken because of the accompanying political obfuscation of integration-ism. It is essential for Afrocentrists to have clarity within the discipline of Africology to help the political advancement of Afrikan people toward liberation from white racial domination and the conceptual defense of the Afrocentric perspective. Afrocentricity can be an intellectual spear and shield so long as it has not been rendered impotent by breach or dilution of obscure aspects of Eurocentrism.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The central questions that will be examined in this study will be: How can an ideologically separatist black nationalist disposition help optimize the practical or functional utility of scholarship produced by Afrocentric intellectuals, if at all? What constitutes this disposition and what are its potential limitations?<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>Methodology<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Historical analysis is what determines the assumptions that undergird a given theory. Often the location and cultural disposition of a theorist determines the interpretation of history and ultimately produces as well as shapes some of the limitations within a theoretical perspective. All theoretical lenses project cultural assumptions into interpretation of data shaping perception and interpretation of history, therefore reality. If a Eurocentric theorist extrapolates European cultural assumptions into their interpretation of Afrikan history, that theorist will likely misinterpret the Afrikan phenomena under evaluation and may even harmfully misrepresent or pathologize Afrikan people in the process. Eurocentric misinterpretation becomes increasingly exacerbated when an analysis of Afrikan phenomena is deployed from a disposition that is intelligible and complicit with an ideologically white supremacist framework. As Dr. Asante states, &#8220;the problem of knowledge regarding Africa is that too many of the Europeans who have written of Africa have had the European project of white domination, of white power, of white race supremacy at the very top of their agenda in the explanations and interpretations of phenomena they saw or information they were given.&#8221; For these reasons, it is my duty to give a multi-dimensional analysis to the materials of this study as a part of an engagement in intellectual warfare with the custodians of white racial domination.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Utilizing Afrocentricity as a mode of analysis is crucial to this study because an Afrocentric methodological approach to our history is necessary in providing us with an understanding of the true depth and degree of Afrikan historical victories, giving us a victorious consciousness in the present moment. By centering the experience of Afrikan people within the assumptions of Afrikan cultural values, historical inquiry can then reveal what Afrikan people have done on their own behalf; agency.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Within the essay by Dr. Danjuma Sinue Modupe called &#8220;The Afrocentric Philosophical Perspective,&#8221; the three pyramidal elements of the Afrocentric rise to consciousness are outlined as grounding, orientation, and perspective. &#8220;Grounding is the acquisition of knowledge and experience centered in the history and culture of people of African descent, continental and diasporan. Orientation is having and pursuing intellectual interests in the African and the formation of a psychological identity direction, based upon that interest in the direction toward Africa. And Perspective is a self-conscious &#8216;way of seeing&#8217; and &#8216;shaping&#8217; the world which reflects African interests and which is indicative of the quality, kind and amount of grounding and orientation.&#8221; While these elements are greatly significant in the development of Afrocentric consciousness a limitation concerning one&#8217;s ability to utilize this consciousness in a constructive fashion is the lack of acknowledgement that one needs to understand how a system of white racial supremacy works.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Grounding without specificity would allow one to cherry pick their way through history without developing a historiographic understanding for how the system of white racial domination is constructed. By perpetually reproducing racist social taxonomies, Europeans deliberately attempt to build totalizing structures which ontologically reduce Afrikan people to facilitate their own interests. Because of the oceanic size of European imperialist an colonial projects have been across the world, Europeans have control over enough material resources to perpetuate their masquerade that supposes Eurocentrism to be universal. Understanding, or at minimum consistently suspecting, this essential quality of whites, their institutions, and their accompanying Eurocentric ideas is what I refer to as &#8220;Systemic Race Consciousness.&#8221; Having systemic race consciousness in conjunction with Afrocentric consciousness is a necessity to develop functionally constructive ideas and ultimately scholarship that will advance Afrikan people toward liberation.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">According to Dr. Molefi Asante, &#8220;Afrocentric scholarship is itself praxis. Afrocentricity as paradigm has propaedeutic value because a myriad of assumptions and basic propositions employed by African American Studies can be examined. Such scholarship as praxis reduces the tendency for individuals to make random non-connected comments, even though comments might be informative. The logic of procedure provides groundwork for others to follow; this is the value of Afrocentric scholarship as work.&#8221; To ensure, that there is a consistent relevance of this Afrocentric inquiry to existential conditions of Afrikan people determined by racism in the United States there are some additional methods to be considered. Dr. Joshua Myers attempts to offer additional methods for Afrikan-centered that should fulfill the goal to need to develop a systemic race consciousness in conjunction with Afrocentric consciousness. Dr. Myers offers six methodological considerations that he unearthed from the works of Dr. Cedric Robinson. The ones I found most useful for the purposes of this paper adhered to building historiographic context around Afrikans in each focus of study. Here are a few that will be of great use:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 39pt\">\n<li>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Understandings of Western ideas and institutions proceed with a critical, thorough and historically-sound assessment of the genesis of that idea within Western civilization.\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Broad understanding of the imposing social structure gives clarity to the ways in which African resistance and\/or acquiescence is meted out as well as their continuities which spring forth from African understandings of reality (i.e. their own governance structures)\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The Africana community writ large is the object [origin] of inquiry; it is the methodological impulse which informs how knowledge is ordered.\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"> These methodological tools will enable an analysis that compounds the Afrocentric engagement with history with a complementary understanding of some of the larger forces of European Imperialism that have formed a variety of political, social, and ultimately ecological factors which shape Afrikan phenomena. Enhancing the Africologicial inquiry with a thorough understanding of aspects which arise in Western Civilization that shape the global system of white racial domination is a sure way to produce optimally constructive Afrocentric scholarship that can be applied to other forms of Afrocentric praxis.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>Literature Review<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The nature of this thesis is to explore the relationship between culture and ideology within the United States. Because it is a racist society that has been shaped in very similar ways as other societies formed by European Imperialism have, by focusing on the works of important international as well as domestic historical figures and scholars who have written on culture, integration-ism, and separatism, the value of this inquiry will be highlighted. Due to the fiscal limitations, this study will only highlight brief historical events to illuminate significant conceptual nuances that are pertinent to the arguments being made.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">To begin a discussion on the diverse usage of the term &#8220;culture,&#8221; I have chosen to focus on aspects of the works of Harold Cruse and Dr. Marimba Ani. Due to the intent of racists to veil their racist bias, Eurocentrism has deceptively attempted to neutralize and suppose itself to be a universal standard. The degree to which that cultural neutrality is challenged is exemplified in the (lack of) clarity per the ideological disposition of each author. Here, we deal with Harold Cruse because of his diverse familiarity with &#8220;Black Thought&#8221; and his own ideological promiscuity. In his book, <em>The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual<\/em>, Harold Cruse&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;culture&#8221; suggests he understands culture to be phenomena that is important and socially experienced pervasively by a distinct group but not a factor that determines the institutional structures of society. Cruse never clearly defines culture, but his discussion of cultural revolutions, cultural democracy, and cultural leadership provide clear insight into the ways that many Afrikan thinkers of his time in the United understood politics and culture to be two distinct phenomena that sometimes intersect with each other. This understanding is displayed here:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 21pt\">&#8220;\u2026the Negro intelligentsia cannot give cultural leadership on these questions because they have sold their birthright for an illusion called Racial Integration. Having given up their strict claim to an ethnic identity in politics, economics and culture, they haven&#8217;t a leg to stand on. They can make no legitimate claims for their group integrity in cultural affairs.&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Cruse sees significance in culture as he notices that the integration-ists have and seek to assimilate into the culture of whites. He clearly understood culture as an important factor connecting not just the social interrelationships between Afrikan people but also their politics. Once cultural assimilation took place by intent, conscription, or confusion the integrationist is no longer representative of the predominant interests of the black community. Now that is a very valuable insight that he provided, but the limitation in Cruse&#8217;s conception of culture is a common one. The same quote above displays that there is a distinction between his understanding of &#8220;culture and economics,&#8221; which suggests to me that he has unintentionally accepted the neutrality of European culture as the determining factor in institutional structures. He sees &#8220;culture&#8221; as what exists or what is produced within those structures. An example of this subtle yet profound misunderstanding is when Cruse refers to &#8220;the idealization of everything African, the return to the natural quality of African hairstyles,\u2026[and] the adoption of African tribal dress&#8221; in &#8220;the Afro-American nationalistic mood&#8221; as &#8220;protective mystiques.&#8221; Without reference to the autonomous institutional efforts of these nationalist organizations, he reduces the rejection of whiteness by blacks and the implication of Afrikan aesthetic reclamation to &#8220;fantasies of black supremacy that have little to do with the actualities of the real world.&#8221; His conceptual grasp for a more robust understanding of the politically-economic and structural implications for culture may be limited because of the general climate of white dominance in his historical moment, but I suspect his inquisitive yet uncommitted ideological leanings had more to do with it.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Dr. Marimba Ani defines culture as Wade Nobles does, as &#8220;a process which gives people a general design for living and patterns for interpreting their reality.&#8221; Dr. Ani understands culture and ideology to fit together nearly synonymously. One way she describes this ideological emphasis on culture is: &#8220;It &#8216;tells&#8217; its members &#8216;what to do,&#8217; thereby creating a &#8216;voice&#8217; of prescriptive authority. To its members, culture re-presents values (which they themselves have created together out of shared experiences) as a systematic set of ideas and a single coherent statement.&#8221; She suggests later that &#8220;the ideological thrust of culture is inescapable.&#8221; With her robust definition of culture, Dr. Ani then draws upon three KiSwahili terms to more acutely qualify other aspects of the European epistemology and manifestations of behavior. First, she develops the concept of <em>asili<\/em>, which is a KiSwahili word that means &#8220;beginning,&#8221; &#8220;origin,&#8221; &#8220;source,&#8221; &#8220;nature,&#8221; &#8220;essence,&#8221; and &#8220;fundamental principle.&#8221; It has also meant &#8220;seed&#8221; and &#8220;germ,&#8221; to more simply refer to the genesis of cultural particularities within her study of European cultural thought. The other two accompanying concepts she uses are &#8220;utamawazo&#8221; which means &#8220;thought as determined by culture&#8221; and the &#8220;utamaroho&#8221; means &#8220;the collective personality&#8221; of the members of a culture. She explains that the asili is the &#8220;DNA of culture.&#8221; The asili is the genesis of all thoughts, behaviors, and creations within the given culture. Her concept of asili is especially important to the study at hand because it allows for a functional conceptualization of the shared cultural continuity of Europeans across space and time. Her assumption that every culture has an asili can be used so that the Afrikan asili and the European asili can be identified and distinctions can be determined through historical comparisons. The clear use of the term &#8220;culture&#8221; in Dr. Ani&#8217;s text is robust enough to capture the essential factors that shape how institutional structures determined and controlled by Europeans behave and are utilized ideologically along the distinct interests of European culture.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Tony Martin gives thorough primary source documentation as substance to display the separatist ideological principles of Marcus Garvey in his book, <em>Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggles of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association<\/em>. Garvey&#8217;s emphasis on race first, nationhood, and self-reliance were exhibited at the core of his and his organization&#8217;s, the U.N.I.A., political philosophy here:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 21pt\"><strong>What We Believe<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 21pt\"><strong>The Universal Negro Improvement Association advocates the unity and blending of all Negroes into one strong, healthy race.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 21pt\"><strong>It is against miscegenation and race suicide.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 21pt\"><strong>It believes that the Negro race is as good as any other, and therefore should be as proud of itself as others are.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 21pt\"><strong>It believes in the purity of the Negro race and the purity of the white race.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin-left: 21pt\"><strong>~ Marcus Garvey<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">One of the critiques of Garvey raised by Martin was Garvey&#8217;s reversals of Darwinist language against pseudo-scientific racists and advancing black self-reliance. Because of the &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; discourse, many racists couched justifications for anti-black\/anti-Afrikan genocide in the Darwinist biological evolutionary theories which supposed the inherent inferiority of Afrikans. Due to the threat of miscegenation with the supposedly inferior races, racists felt that the white race needed to exterminate perceived degenerate races of world to ensure the evolutionary trajectory of the white human race. Marcus Garvey &#8220;turned their arguments into the cause for self-reliance&#8221; by arguing &#8220;white philosophers, Darwin, Locke, Newton and the rest\u2026forgot that the monkey would change to a man, his tail would drop off and he would demand his share.&#8221; While Garvey is drawing from a Eurocentric theoretical disposition, the directional approach to his message is a challenge to white domination through the upliftment of the black race and the contradiction of the supposed racial inferiority of black people. The last crucial part of Garvey&#8217;s idea for a separate black nation was the necessity for black people to have power. Garvey did not understand the problem of anti-black racial hatred and oppression to be a moral issue purely about prejudice. Garvey&#8217;s understanding of the racial power dynamics resulting in black oppression was that &#8220;(white prejudice was manifested) not because there is a difference between us in religion or in colour, but because there is a difference in power.&#8221; Again, there is a conceptual limitation because there are important distinctions to be made between black people and white people; Afrikans and Europeans are fundamentally different in many ways; but the emphasis on power is key. Garvey understood the question of power and autonomy to be answered through an independent economic base.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Integration can often be an obscure term because of its widespread usage within political discourse. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the most famous proponents of integration-ism for the Afrikan population into white American society. For Dr. King, integration meant a moral reconciliation between the collectives of white people and black people in America so that black people would be afforded equal access of opportunity to pursue the American Dream. This is displayed here:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 21pt\">&#8220;In our kind of society liberation cannot come without integration and integration cannot come without liberation. I speak here of integration in both the ethical and political senses. One the one hand, integration is true intergroup, interpersonal living. On the other hand, it is the mutual sharing of power. I cannot see how the Negro will be liberated from the crushing weight of poor education, squalid housing and economic strangulation until he is integrated, with power, into every level of American life.&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Dr. King understood integration to an exercise of power on behalf of the already ruling class of American society, white people. A reflection on the past situations of interracial interpersonal living can only draw attention to the Antebellum period of American history. Was chattel enslavement not integration? In sharp contrast from the separatist disposition of Marcus Garvey, for instance, the burden of Afrikan liberation from white domination has been given to the perpetrators of the original crime of anti-black\/anti-Afrikan oppression. The shared emphasis on the need for economic empowerment is consistent between the positions. The necessity for moral reckoning by white people is a resounding sentiment from Afrikan people with integrationist dispositions who would rather neglect the historicity of perpetual white racism.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>Order of Analysis<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">First, I will give an examination of the failures of integrationist initiatives throughout the history of the United States to show a collective unwillingness, lack of interest, and inability of white society to structurally integrate any critical mass of black people into itself. By engaging aspects of American history and Afrikan responses to racism, I will demonstrate how white supremacy is a system that cannot be reformed or pivoted to benefit the collective interests of black people, and how therefore racism in the United States is permanent. This is one key factor for &#8220;systemic&#8221; race consciousness.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">With a conceptual turn away from integration-ism and by building on Martin Delany&#8217;s thesis of black people in the United states being a &#8220;nation within a nation,&#8221; I can show how an ideologically separatist black nationalist disposition is conceptually consistent with the aforementioned &#8220;permanence of racism&#8221; thesis. Displaying how the habituality of racism in American society reflects the historical behavior of Europeans and this perpetual white antagonism further emphasizes the need for Afrikan people to materially institutionalize separatism.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Engaging the works of some Afrikan-centered\/Afrocentric scholars like Cheikh Anta Diop, Jacob Carruthers, Frances Cress Welsing, Marimba Ani and others qualifying the historical animus of European imperialism, colonialism, and white racism can be located within the origins of European culture. Diop&#8217;s Two Cradle Theory and Welsing&#8217;s Cress Color Theory provide conceptual bases for European behavior and white racism. The system of white racial domination in the United States is the systematic institutionalization of European culture and that dislocates Afrikans through cultural hegemony. Understanding this bring us to a clearer understanding of how historically their tendencies of xenophobia and perpetual antagonism reflect their cultural disposition.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Finally, to demonstrate conceptual problems of epistemic convergence between Afrocentricity with Eurocentrism, I will display some of the contemporary institutional and persisting conceptual problems that Afrocentrists are presented with in their attempts to produce Afrocentric scholarship consistent with Dr. Mazama&#8217;s functional aspect of the Afrocentric Paradigm.  Some barriers and pressures Afrocentrists are faced with, but have been answered are questions about pairing race first and Afrocentric theory with Eurocentric class analysis and Eurocentric gender theory. In this section, I will discuss problems of simultaneity, the terms of debate around essentialism, and some implications.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">As a corrective, systemic race consciousness presents a complementary addition to Afrocentricity by way of allowing the Afrocentrist to accurately map out the history of conflict between Afrikan people and their Eurasian colonial enemies in the United States. A separatist black nationalist disposition is the result of a clear historical consciousness or systemic race consciousness and it allows the Afrocentrist to see the reality and perpetually antagonistic nature of racism\/white supremacy as they engage in the scholastic aspect of our struggle for liberation.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>CHAPTER 2: THE INQUIRY<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>The Failure of Integration<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>&#8220;The only difference between America and South Africa, South Africa preaches separation and practices separation, America preaches integration and practices segregation.

The French adopted openly assimilationist policies as a part of their imperial agendas throughout Afrika, the Caribbean, and Asia. The French would miseducate, &#8220;groom&#8221;, and Europeanize minorities of their colonial subjects by convincing them to adopt French culture, while plundering the material resources unearthed and produced by a greater majority of a conscripted indigenous population. Assimilated Afrikans misunderstood themselves to be Frenchmen, were told by whites that they were indeed Frenchmen, and in turn helped whites to retain control over the larger population of Afrikan people under imperial or colonial domination. Another more recent example of the dubious nature of European imperialism\/colonialism is the collapse of the formal apartheid system in South Africa. Whites &#8220;compromised&#8221; on integrationist reform policies such as &#8220;one man, one vote&#8221; as a supposed middle ground where they complied with some of the moderate demands from the African National Congress, while insulating white domination under terms of reconciliation and retaining their imperial foothold in the cape of Afrika. The larger implication is that South Africa remains a haven and outpost for white racial domination in that region of the Afrika which coordinates with other Western (neo)colonial powers to breach the sovereignty of bordering countries throughout the cape of Afrika for retention of their spheres of influence, political hegemony, and kleptomaniacal material interests to this day. All these policies of European imperialism, colonialism, and racism that have been deployed by whites were produced utilizing syntheses of various Enlightenment philosophies, all of which are conceptually Eurocentric.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The Eurocentric ideas which elevate Europeans in the minds of conscripted Afrikans have historically been systematically imposed through various institutions of American society such as churches, universities, and government in aspects like the Christian religious doctrines of Manifest Destiny, the biological (and sociological) evolutionary theories of (Social) Darwinism, and the racial codification of the law. Europeans have propagandized aspects of themselves to perpetuate the nationalist myths of American exceptionalism and white superiority. Europeans have hegemonically supposed their own moral virtue to be higher than that of Afrikan people through the anthropomorphizing of whiteness into images of divinity; white Jesus; that they imposed unto enslaved Afrikans with Christianity. Evolutionary thinking taught throughout American universities was couched within the myth of white superiority and canonized after the popularization of the works of Charles Darwin and Francis Galton which are now, as was then concurrently, seminal texts for theories of evolutionary biology. The Darwin text, <em>On the Origin of Species<\/em>, was produced with the explicit intent to provide &#8220;objective&#8221; scientific credence to anthropological ideas that the white race is further &#8220;evolved than the Negro and aboriginal races of the world.&#8221;<\/span><br \/>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Francis Galton was one of the early developers of what later became the eugenics movement.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Returning to the chronology of American history, the project that ultimately became what we now know as the United States of America cannot be divorced from the other European projects of imperialism. In fact, the American project is a nationalist project of white supremacy that began with the near total extermination of the indigenous peoples of the North American continent and then later became an imperial project for aiding the facilitation of global white domination. Afrikan people were kidnapped, enslaved, and shipped from the shores of West Afrika across the ocean into North America as a part of a European crime syndicate that primarily dealt in the trade and commerce of Afrikan flesh for labor. Despite the small minority of token instances where &#8220;free&#8221; Afrikans participated in the fruitful exploits of American society, the overwhelming majority of Afrikan people had been subject to the miserable brutality of chattel enslavement. After the Civil War ended in 1865 and chattel enslavement was legally terminated, rather than incorporate the large population of Afrikans into the infrastructure of American society, whites sought ways to continuously exploit Afrikan labor through peonage and convict-leasing. Throughout the period of Jim Crow segregation in the North and the South, anti-black violence was used as a tool for economic debasement of Afrikan families. The further development of convict-leasing after Antebellum enslavement into the beginnings of what would soon be known as the prison industrial complex after the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements of the 1960s and 70s has been a process for re-enslavement of the Afrikan population in America under different terms, yet still within the caveat of the Constitution of the United States.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">From the historiographic perspective of Afrikan people in the United States, it&#8217;s more accurate to say Afrikan people are not merely a disenfranchised demographic of American society, rather its more consistent to understand them as colonized by American society. America is a white settler state. The consistent failures of integration-ism in the United States should be interpreted as failures by some black people to effectively assimilate into a European colonial apparatus that is imposed upon and exploits them to facilitate this white project. The collective of Afrikan people in North America generally hasn&#8217;t ever been considered by powerful whites in the overall policies inclusive to American citizenship, nor socially or conceptually included in &#8220;humanity.&#8221; By assimilating into European culture, mentally conscripted Afrikans believed that they could evolve into the supposedly virtuous lawful company of their white masters. Given the historical processes of Antebellum chattel enslavement and Jim Crow segregation\/apartheid, the integrationist initiatives of the 1950s and 60s had leaders chosen and elevated by whites based on inferiority complexes instilled into Afrikan people during aforementioned episodes of American history. Usually the failures of integration are posited as moral dilemma where there was a failure of white society to realize and accept &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221; blacks into their good graces then include them in the material benefits of citizenship.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The understanding of the centrality of race as the primary determinant that shapes the institutional structures and social taxonomies of American society is a crucial component to any conceptualization that is to be of constructive use for Afrikan people here. According to Dr. Tommy Curry, &#8220;race must me understood as a product of the self-sustaining interest whites had in preserving their superiority; but, on the other hand, it cannot be ignored that African descended people have epistemically contoured race toward their own cultural ends&#8221;. Afrikan identity is also organized around the sociological relationships between black people, in the Afrikan continent and throughout the diaspora. A culture. In its broadest context, Afrikan culture is Afrikan people seeking to retain and reproduce their own way of life and survival by engaging with or against environmental conditions, whether naturally occurring or manufactured by enemies. Cedric Robinson describes the formation of what he understands to be the Black Radical Tradition as &#8220;\u2026the continuing development of a collective consciousness informed by the historical struggles for liberation and motivated by the shared sense of obligation to preserve the collective being, the ontological totality&#8221;. The advancement of most if not all interests for Afrikan people living under the American system of white racial domination must be tied to our race as black people. Black racial identity is the marker to identify prominent masses of the Afrikan people. Simply put, you won&#8217;t find a large mass of culturally Afrikan people with white skin. Black politics are Afrikan cultural formations. Potency is determined by Afrikan cultural retention. Afrikan people cannot afford to &#8220;think past&#8221; race and focus only on Afrikan culture because there is the potential to abstract ourselves outside of our material condition. Offering purely philosophical solutions to material problems shaped by white domination that we face on the ground isn&#8217;t constructive.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">One of the key problems many have in understanding racism\/white supremacy is recognizing and consistently operationalizing the distinction and significance between just &#8216;race&#8217; and &#8216;racism.&#8217; Analyses of &#8216;race&#8217; can vary according to situation, but racism\/white supremacy can only be fully understood with a systematic analysis. &#8220;Traditional approaches view the prejudices associated with individual and cultural racism as universal traits that can be manifested in any group, at any time in any given social situation.&#8221; Isolating situations of racial prejudice from the greater systemic causality of white supremacy, centers an afflicted individual or group of individuals rather that the oppressed collective in the analysis. This is a necessary tactic for understanding the nuances of particular events and sites of analysis but is an insufficient method for analyzing the systemic quality of white supremacy and the historical personality that has characterized the general trends of Europeans&#8217; behavior toward Afrikan people.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Invoking an idea of Martin Delany will help with the task of conceptualizing the status of Afrikans in America without relenting against the systemic imposition of oppression by their political enemies. In his work <em>Condition, Elevation, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States<\/em>, Delany writes:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 21pt\">&#8220;There have in all ages, in almost every nation, existed a nation within a nation\u2014a people who although forming a part and parcel of the population, yet were from force of circumstances, known by the peculiar position they occupied, forming in restricted part of the body politic of such nations is also true\u2026 such then is the condition of various classes in Europe; yes, nations, for centuries within nations, even without the hope of redemption among those who oppress them. And however unfavorable their condition, there is none more so than that of the colored people of the United States.&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This notion of Afrikan people in America being a &#8220;nation within a nation&#8221; has been drawn upon by many revolutionaries, scholars, and intellectuals since for conceptual space to produce functional practices toward the liberation of Afrikan people under American domestic colonialism. This colonial status has been observed and described by white intellectuals such as De Tocqueville, Gunnar Mydral, Kenneth Clark, Andrew Hacker, Studs Terkel and others. Some of the most notable examples of Afrikan revolutionary organizations who have echoed Delany&#8217;s radical sentiments for the need for black people in America to establish a separate nation are the United Negro Improvement Association, Nation of Islam, and The Republic of New Afrika.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Beginning with the assumption that the conceptual framework through which we should interpret the historical experience of Afrikans in America as &#8220;a nation within a nation,&#8221; naturally contextualizes the terms of anti-black\/anti-Afrikan oppression in the United States as a form of colonialism. This is consistent with pronouncements by intellectuals like Harold Cruse that &#8220;from the beginning [of American history], the American Negro has always existed as a colonial being,&#8221; ultimately shaping later iterations of internal (neo)colonization theory and race realism.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Within his book, <em>Faces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism<\/em>, Derrick Bell fully acknowledges the shortcomings of integration-ism with his central thesis which proclaims that &#8220;racism is permanent in American society.&#8221; As Bell argues in the 1990s that the few, yet achieved, merits of civil rights legislation gained in the 1960s have been withered away over the decades, he shows how this decadence reflects the cyclical nature of American racism which is teleological feature of American society. In Bell&#8217;s words:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 21pt\">&#8220;Black people will never gain full equality in this country. Even those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than temporary &#8216;peaks of progress,&#8217; short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance. This is a hard to accept fact that all history verifies. We must acknowledge it, not as a sign of submission, but as an act of ultimate defiance.&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This pessimistic attitude is not a complete nihilism of the abilities of black people in America, but rather it is a grounded nihilistic conclusion about the historically amoral white racist collective that has retained structural power in America since its conception. Equality is a philosophical standard that holds little value for a people who have a different yard stick of success for themselves outside of a binary with their oppressive political enemies. The standard of achieving alternate forms of liberation outside of seeking equality and inclusion in to white\/American society have been articulated within the ideological discourse of black nationalism and explored throughout the historical mobilization of black nationalist organizations. As a functional, though continually repressed, response to white domination &#8220;black nationalism was the earliest and most dominant branch of African thought in America prior to integration.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Recognizing that there are various strands of Black Nationalism, the overarching definition for a black nationalist disposition here will be &#8220;a consciousness of a shared experience of oppression at the hands of white people, an awareness and approval of the persistence of group traits and preferences in spite of a violently anti-African larger society, a recognition of bonds and obligations between Africans everywhere, [and] an irreducible conviction that Africans in America must take responsibility for liberating themselves.&#8221; The principal difference between the black nationalist disposition and an integrationist disposition is where the burden of responsibility lies. Because integrationists seek access and proximity to white society the burden of responsibility rests within the hands of white people with power. Integration-ism is contingent on a moral reckoning by the white brokers of power who have continually oppressed, exploited, systematically massacred blacks to advance their interests to sustain white domination and affluence. Black nationalism places the moral responsibility to salvage, rebuild, and protect communities of Afrikan people within the hands of Afrikan people themselves.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This self-help idea within black nationalism is very different from the scapegoating tactics within both racist conservative and liberal pathological discourse, which blames intra-racial violence on pathologies of black communities. Here are some examples of how these different ideological dispositions play out in public discourse.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Generally, people who abide politically by conservatism in the United States are those who prefer to strictly retain the political traditions that are customary to American society. Conservatives have the greatest tendency to be white (rich and poor), overtly racist, and\/or dislocated black people. This is not a historical account of the political parties engaged in the electoral college of the American democratic republic, but rather a general summation of the ruling traditions throughout U.S. history. The political philosophies of conservatives are often attached to their material and structural consequences that are to the benefit or detriment of whites in power or more generally, because their philosophies tend to be historically grounded, accompanied by power, and are used to advance interests of their white supremacist constituency. Their power is not only insulation from progressive tides of social movements, it also allows them to exercise substantial influence institutionally to produce social climates that reflect their racist exploitative interests. Often conservative public discourse pathologically suggests that &#8220;the blame is on blacks for starting their own problems, so the responsibility is with blacks to fix their problems.&#8221; They project anti-black\/anti-Afrikan pathology unto the victims of their collaborative efforts while removing the blame for their complicity from themselves.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Liberalism is generally a political philosophy of the &#8220;progressive minded&#8221; folks who want to reshape the United States into a state that maximizes the democratic ideals of the Constitution without alienating any side of their often racially amalgamated constituency. By playing both sides of an asymmetrical war against the oppressed internal nation of black people, white liberals often choose between their individualist interests via conformity to or paternalist advocacy for concessions to dependent black people. The liberal discourse tends to be more moral and abstract in nature due to their lack of power and their dependency on allocations from more powerful and conservative parties. Dr. Curry writes, &#8220;under the integrationist teleology, the jettisoning of race is consistent with a normative universalism that equates truth and progress with the elimination of racial distinctions.&#8221; Their political obfuscation then translates to apologetic black people who seek integration on Eurocentric terms. Liberal public discourse often faults no one by saying, &#8220;the blame for all of the problems of race fall on all of us, so the solution to these problems are all of ours.&#8221; Racist paternalism and anti-black pathology persist. As to where black nationalist discourse largely says, &#8220;the blame for starting problems in our communities is on the system of white supremacy, so the responsibility to fix the problem falls on us who understand this.&#8221; This systematic understanding of white domination that black nationalists are forced to have because of their assumed accountability is crucial for a corrective to the inferiority complex many black people have been indoctrinated with.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">With the understanding that white domination in the U.S. is systemic in nature, reforming the structures and institutions of its composition can at best only be half-measure to ending anti-black oppression. The legal system, while rigidly enforced upon people without power or who aren&#8217;t of valued status within white society, has repeatedly proved to be an insufficient measure against racism. The problem with relying on the criminal justice system to solve the problems afflicting Afrikan people in the United States is that the criminal justice system is an institution of white supremacy and is complicit in continually reproduced damages to Afrikan people. Racism is frequently extralegal for this reason. Even when a racist act falls within the jurisdiction of a given set of laws, whites are often exonerated. Rather than jumping through the everchanging hoops of the legal system which black people have consistently never had control over or significant influence over in their own interest and terms, Afrocentrists should operate from the assumption that the cultural logic of white supremacy will determine the environment in which their intellectual production will be utilized within.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>Perpetual White Antagonism<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t understand racism\/white supremacy, then everything you do understand will only confuse you&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>~ Neely Fuller Jr.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>&#8220;If you begin your history with slavery, then the best you will ever be is a good slave&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>~ Kwame Ture (a.k.a.

Beginning chronologically at the earliest expression of European civilization will allow us to see the adolescent nature of European imperialism which will ultimately morph into its contemporary racialized organizational structure. Looking to Cheikh Anta Diop&#8217;s Two Cradle Theory will give an understanding of the development of the Northern Cradle to illuminate xenophobic aspects of European culture which later manifest again within contemporary expressions of whiteness. Building on what&#8217;s provided by Diop, Dr. Jacob Carruthers&#8217;s concept of &#8220;fundamental alienation&#8221; demonstrates some of the qualities of European thought which form an inclination toward perpetual imposition. Next, Dr. Frances Cress Welsing&#8217;s Cress Color Confrontation Theory will allow for the formulation of insight into the genetic and psychological interests which shape the behavior Europeans have historically displayed toward Afrikan people, especially. These theories will give a robust understand for the qualitative nature of the contemporary system of white racial domination and will reinforce the significance of a systemic race consciousness for Afrikan people and a separatist black nationalist ideological disposition.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Other scholars such as Vulindlela Wobogo, Nah Dove, Karanja Keita Carroll, Daudi Ajani ya Azibo, and others have utilized Diop&#8217;s Two Cradle Theory to locate the origin of white racist behavior of Europeans within their cultural root in Antiquity. Cheikh Anta Diop&#8217;s Two Cradle Theory describes how it is a natural progression for any group of human beings to share a culture after living together for extended periods of time. There are distinct influences of different geographical spaces on the groups of people living in each environment shaping distinct cultures. The models for the Northern Cradle were located on the Eurasian steppes making Rome and Greece the most significant civilizations in the region. The models for the Southern Cradle were located the Nile Valley where Kemet and Nubia were the dominant civilizations. The peoples of Western Asia were within what Diop called the Zone of Confluence, where peoples of the Northern and Southern cradles mixed culturally and biologically.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In the Northern Cradle, the dominant culture of the indigenous people in the region of the Eurasian steppes north of the Mediterranean was predominantly shaped by destitute environments and harsh unpredictable climates. This geographical circumstance along with the scarcity of food and other material resources necessary for survival led to the pervasive development of nomadic cultural groups throughout the region classified as the Northern Cradle by Diop. The early cultural formations of people indigenous to the Northern Cradle are described as having individualistic intra-group behaviors, xenophobic out-group behaviors, patriarchal social dynamics, an exploitative orientation to material, alienated cosmological assumptions related to meta-physical phenomena.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In the Southern Cradle, the dominant culture that had been developed and established within the Nile Valley of Afrika was predominantly shaped by an abundance of natural resources and a relatively stable tropical climate. According to Diop, due to the environmental conditions people indigenous to the region of the Southern Cradle lived within they developed a sedentary culture. Some of the dominant aspects of Southern Cradle cultural formations were collective-oriented social structures, xenophilic relations with benign out-groups, non-hierarchal dual gendered familial structures, assumed ontological unity of the total cosmos, and others.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cultural continuity of Europe from the civilizations of antiquity to the modern capitalist states of today is historically displayed in the waves of conquest between European nations. Wobogo argues that white racism originated in pre-capitalist European nomadism because he understands the &#8220;ethnocentric-xenophobic mentality&#8221;  to be a cultural particularity of Europeans. Dove argues that the racist behavior of Europeans has its origins in their &#8220;culturally patriarchal&#8221; disposition and is &#8220;genetically influenced.&#8221; By &#8220;genetically influenced,&#8221; Dove is referring to the role the genetic insecurity whites are socially complexed with due to their apparent genetically recessive skin color. The women in Europe have been politically and socially debased within their own societies as their value has been reduced to their reproductive capabilities by European men. Part of why European men socially repress European women they share a society with is to retain control over the reproduction of more men to satisfy their fixation on war and jingoism.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In his book, Mdw Ntr=Divine Speech: A Historical Reflection of African Deep Thought from the Time of Pharaohs to the Present, Dr. Jacob Carruthers conceptualizes a process in Greek thought where abstract concepts and thinking are divorced from empirical reality called &#8220;Fundamental Alienation.&#8221; This process despiritualizes abstract ideals within European thought, rather than inseparably implicating them within the totality of the cosmos as Afrikan spiritualized ontologically bound assumptions would. From within the cultural assumptions of Europeans, ideas and abstractions are not connected to the material realties. Fundamental alienation directly shapes the alienated cosmological assumptions from Eurasian people of the Northern Cradle. The idea of the Creator Divinity is fundamentally alienated, so conception of God is purely abstract. Along with the alienation of divinity, ideals are alienated within in European thought as well. This is also reflected in the ideal nature of Plato&#8217;s Republic.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Striving toward neutrality, objectivity, or omnipotence simultaneously produces a God complex and an epistemic puritanical antagonism toward plurality. With a presumption of objectivity, once you know the universal truth, that&#8217;s it. There are no new truths. There is no dynamism or motion. Within this epistemology, if someone grows and learns enough where they uncover a new truth then that means their original position wasn&#8217;t the &#8220;one truth.&#8221; Objectivity is static. When a perspective is unable to grow and learn more complex truths than was already understood, that perspective is dogmatic. Within this Eurocentric epistemology, diversity of perspectives presented within a given collective cannot be fully embraced. Plurality of perspectives is equivalent to plurality of truths or beliefs and for &#8220;objectivity&#8221; to be sustained, the &#8220;objective&#8221; view must be dogmatic and it must impose itself upon dissenters. The logic described here reflects the historical processes of religious evangelicalism and cultural hegemony performed by Eurasians across the world for millennia. Abstract concepts, being alienated and despiritualized, can now be used as rhetorical weapons of moral evangelism and epistemic imprisonment. Dr. Marimba Ani calls these tools of universalist deception, &#8220;rhetorical ethic&#8221; or &#8220;Christian ethic.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This concept of rhetorical ethic is a European phenomenon which refers to a &#8220;gap between verbal expression and belief or commitment; between what people say and what they do.&#8221; Because of the fundamental alienation within the European worldview, the implications of words are alienated from their invocation. Dr. Ani describes how Europeans use this rhetorical ethic to the end of advancing expansionist ideologies:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 21pt\">&#8220;The Christian statement said that religion should be &#8216;universal,&#8217; thereby discrediting other religions that were obviously and avowedly culture-bound. It claimed, in fact, to be the properly &#8216;universalistic&#8217; religion; giving European conquerors the moral justification they needed to turn their politically aggressive actions into seemingly altruistic ones.&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Some of the examples of seemingly benign or altruistic universalisms that Europeans have used as purely abstract weapons of Eurasian intellectual imperialism are &#8220;communist utopia,&#8221; &#8220;democracy,&#8221; &#8220;humanity,&#8221; and even as of recently in the United States &#8220;Make America Great Again.&#8221; Due to the two-sided nature of European ethic, &#8220;Europeans have developed and entire semantical system designed for export\u2014for the purposes of nationalistic propaganda\u2014for appearance\u2014for others.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To counter, within an Afrikan context there are ontologically bound abstract concepts which are understood to be inseparable from implication upon their invocation like concept of Ma&#8217;at which means order, balance and other cardinal virtues that governed Kemet, an Afrikan society. One of the pictographs used to write the word is a stone cutting and measuring tool.  Ma&#8217;at was appropriated from the literal work of masonry to become a metaphor that could be used to measure abstract concepts and equivocate them to being square, plumb, or sound. Such abstractions include someone&#8217;s character, the quality of their actions, or other intangible aspects of human personalities.  Ma&#8217;at could be used for individuals as well as a measure for collective or societal stability.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This summary of events in Kemet is telling of the essence of  Ma&#8217;at in relationship to not just cosmological matters but also to the political and social realities of Afrikan people. Dr. Carruthers offers us numerous examples of how Ma&#8217;at was used as an ethical barometer in social and political matters relating to everyday social life. One example Carruthers directs us to for clarity is the story of &#8220;The Eloquent Peasant&#8221; where a farmer who was a victim of corruption displayed his gift of &#8220;good speech&#8221; as he insists that  Ma&#8217;at must be done and restored by the ruler.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The functionality of objectivity in perpetuating Eurocentrism and white racial domination in that &#8220;her focus is not only on the motivating factors underlying the behaviors, but also on the terminology that is used to normalize racist behavior and strip it of its racial implications by shielding it under the cloak of objectivity and universalism.&#8221; Another scholar that refers to the role of genetics in the shaping of the behavior of Europeans is Dr. Frances Cress Welsing. While there has been some criticism of Dr. Welsing&#8217;s &#8220;Cress Color-Confrontation Theory&#8221; by referring to it as biologically determinist, there has yet to be sufficient refutation of the sociological aspects of her theory which remain consistent with the historical behaviors of white people. The significant parts of the Cress theory are where Dr. Welsing articulates how white people genetically and socially relate to Afrikan people. On a collective consciousness level, Dr. Welsing argues that black skinned people are percieved by white skinned people as a threat to the genetic survival of white race. Here Dr. Welsing states how genetically:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 21pt\">&#8220;Is it not true that white people represent in numerical terms a very small minority of the world&#8217;s people? And more profoundly, is not &#8216;white&#8217; itself the very absence of any ability to produce color? I reason then that the quality of whiteness is indeed genetic inadequacy or a relative genetic deficiency state, based upon the genetic inability to produce the skin pigments of melanin (which is responsible for all skin color). The vast majority of the world&#8217;s people are not so afflicted, which suggests that color is normal for human beings and color absence is abnormal.&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Dr. Welsing describes how this manifests socially, or rather psychologically, here:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 21pt\">&#8220;the white or color-deficient Europeans responded psychologically, with a profound sense of numerical inadequacy and color inferiority, in their confrontations with the majority of the world&#8217;s people \u2013 all of whom possessed varying degrees of color-producing capacity. This psychological response, whether conscious or unconscious, revealed an inadequacy based on the most obvious and fundamental part of their being, their external appearance.&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">This color-confrontation with other melanated peoples of the world shaped how white peoples of the world shaped their societies. Regardless of the sedentary quality of Afrikan societies, the insecurity white people had caused them to produce social systems that were antagonistic toward groups of black-skinned Afrikan people in close proximity to them who were largely disinterested with them outside of defense from Eurasian raids in Afrikan territories. Together, the genetic insecurity, the environmental acculturating within the Northern Cradle, and by now the fear of retribution correlate, if not prove, that white racism is amorally within the collective interest and cultural disposition of Europeans to sustain wherever they are. Their despiritualization or fundamental alienation makes Europeans prone to not just perpetual antagonism and jingoism, but also to hegemonic imposition of their culture. Eurocentrism is never idle and there is no neutrality. Looking to the history of the United States, the constant unprovoked psychological, violent, attacks on all Afrikan people reflects the perpetually antagonistic historical character of the white collective. Systemic race consciousness leads one to understand that institutionalized separatism takes the question of perpetual white antagonism into account when functionally looking for a liberated future for Afrikan people.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>Problems of Epistemic Convergence<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing you have to get through your mind, and keep it!

Europeans sought to conquer and gain control over every aspect of every group of people they encountered including both their geographic and conceptual territories. Cultural others were relegated to positions of inferiority within the mind of Europeans and this manifested in the mischaracterizations of the cultural productions of non-Europeans, including their ideas and concepts.  Because Eurocentric ideas of are grounded in European history, which makes them an amalgamation of European cultural agency in conceptual form, the self-determining agency of Afrikan people outside of conscription to European agendas is theoretically marginalized from most if not all Eurocentric ideas. An example of this is Karl Marx. Marx only factored Afrikan people into his conceptualization of class-conflict as objects of enslavement, but failed to realize the full range of their cosmological assumptions, ontological orientations, and axiological systems which may have and did contradict the supposed universalist teleology of &#8220;human&#8221; behavior under capitalist exploitation. Given the alien nature of Marx&#8217;s ideas, concepts, and theories to Afrikan agency and self-determination, application toward Afrikan phenomena would be extrapolation and a hegemonic act of dis-agency. This can be seen in the common neglect of the role and full significance of Afrikan spiritual traditions had in Afrikan resistance to European imperialism by Marxists in their historical materialist analyses of Afrikan history. The Pan-Africanist and Marxist-Leninist-Trotskyist historian C.L.R. James&#8217; neglect for the role of Voodoo in the Haitian Revolution in his seminal text, The Black Jacobins, is but one example.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Dr. Asante mentioned in a lecture a brilliant understanding of this phenomena when he stated, &#8220;even many of the most severe critics of Eurocentrism have yet to escape it.&#8221; Many Afrikan intellectuals have attempted to repurpose or reform the ideas of Europeans to advance the interests of Afrikan people under European domination. The problem for Afrikan people is that if Eurocentrism isn&#8217;t totally rejected, then remaining trapped within the European cultural matrix is inevitable. Even within attempts to resist and fight against to dominant paradigms, without epistemologically separate position outside of Eurocentrism an Afrikan would remain &#8220;lynched&#8221; or conceptually incarcerated.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Afrocentricity is so clearly a sufficient corrective to this totalizing aspect of Eurocentrism because it provides conceptual ground for Afrikan people to stand on, on their own terms. The relocation to an Afrocentric position isn&#8217;t merely a reactionary flight from Eurocentric conceptual space, but it is an epistemological project of conceptually rebuilding and returning to who we are. This was brilliantly articulated by Dr. Molefi Asante in a response to Cornel Wests&#8217; disinclination to being &#8220;centered and rooted.&#8221; He wrote &#8220;one must be open to the possibilities of dynamism, moving and flowing, but you have to be moving and flowing from some base. Those who do not move from a base are just floating in the air.&#8221; Providing a base, the separatist disposition manifests conceptually in an Afrocentrists&#8217; scholarship. One of the rigid stipulations of Afrocentricity is that &#8220;an Afrocentrist will never reject the centrality of Afrika as a source of knowledge.&#8221; The basis for this premise should not be understood as a rigid continentalism predicated on locality, but rather a recognition that all black people are indigenous to Afrika and therein, Afrikan culture which has been produced by the self-determination of black people all over the world is a sufficient source of knowledge and concepts for Afrikan people to utilize toward their liberation.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Blackness and Afrikanity, inseparably, have been characterized by diabolically essentialist stereotypes and caricatures by white supremacists who were mass producing images and ideas to serve as pretexts to justify imperial and colonial exploits such as chattel enslavement, segregation, and criminalization of black people. After the period of integration-ism in the 1960s, politics that were organized strictly based on blackness or Afrikanity as a common ground for Afrikan people to unify (i.e. black nationalism, Pan-Afrikanism), became understood by the white masses to be a reversal of racism. Many Eurocentric scholars became cautious and paranoid of casting blanket generalized interpretations of Afrikan people with the worry of being lumped into the supposed racist &#8220;past&#8221; of Europeans. This shift began to implicate mainstream discourse around politics pertaining to race and racism, making it largely apologetically racist in the public sphere. As Black Studies emerged as within the universities across the United States, discourse about blackness and Afrikanity became largely framed in terms of essentialism vs anti-essentialism.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In the academy, many scholars have retreated into a reactionary, yet consistently Eurocentric disposition, for their analyses of Afrikan people; anti-essentialism. The anti-essentialist side argued that black people were not monolithic and the side who continually argued that black people do share common traits, of which should be the basis for black solidarity were deemed racial essentialists. This pejorative is used as an attempt to bully race, Afrikan-centered, or Afrocentric scholars into compliance with Eurocentric terms of discourse. Utilizing this rhetorical ethic of universalist Eurocentric ideas, racists can deceive and conscript Afrikan people into their ways of thinking, behaviors, and political agendas. The veil of supposed-universalism that accompanies Eurocentric ideas works as an epistemic prison for those who assume the perspective and orientation.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The token ascension of Barack Obama to the pinnacle of integration-ism, one of the most powerful offices of the contemporary climate in the era of white racial domination, the Presidency of the United States greatly exacerbated this problem. The discourse around race became even more severely slanted toward color-blindness and post-racialism, giving rise to post-structuralist frames through which scholars insisted upon philosophical understandings of race and racism; an interpretive fluid understanding of race; debased of historiographical context and systemic race consciousness. With the logic that a common essence or trait is never shared between individuals, Afrikan people are still left without a unifying principle for themselves. From their anti-essentialist positions, there is an assumption made by many Eurocentric academics that any position that assumes a collective political or cultural interest of Afrikan people is essentialist, therefore too simple, static, and monolithic to begin an &#8220;objective&#8221; or sufficient analysis of Afrikan people.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Beginning with the history of both Europeans and Afrikans since the late 15th century, it can be largely shown that anti-black racism has been and continues to be the central factor that determines and sustains class status in societies of European (neo)colonial determination, while gender and sexuality have been nuances to the institutional structures formed by larger historical projects. The additive method, not only obfuscates the analysis by imposing Eurocentric theoretical constructs unto of Afrikan phenomena, but also suggests an anti-essentialist presumption about Afrikanity. If Afrikanity isn&#8217;t allowed to stand on its own terms, then the pairing of other non-Afrikan identities and paradigms often invites theoretical perspectives outside of the scope of Afrocentricity which usually originate from within the domain of Eurocentrism. Some of the popular Eurocentric theoretical impositions upon Afrikan people through this &#8220;pairing&#8221; are feminist and Marxist assumptions, given the compulsory mandate that race be accompanied by class, and gender in liberal arts colleges throughout most American universities.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">In his book, <em>The Invisible Jim Crow<\/em>, Dr. Micheal Tilletson has a concept called Agency Reduction Formation. Dr. Tilletson defines Agency Reduction Formations as &#8220;any system of thought that distracts, neutralizes, or reduces the need and desire for assertive collective agency by African Americans.&#8221; Because institutions of white supremacy reproduce systems of thought which reify the behaviors and ideological agendas of the white collective, it can only be expected that these same institutions and systems of thought would effectively decrease assertive Afrikan agency toward the end of eliminating white domination.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Simultaneity is double consciousness, a twoness, or from an Afrocentric perspective, confused consciousness. Understanding that ideas emerge from a cultural assumption, all ideas are inseparable from the system of thought they emerge from. Afrocentricity emerges from the Afrikan mind seeking clarity for itself on its own terms. Eurocentrism is a fundamentally different system of thought that Afrikan people are forced to grapple with, defend themselves from, and fight against. Epistemic convergence between Afrocentricity and Eurocentrism compromises the ability of an Afrocentrist to produce Afrocentric scholarship with functional utility. No one can serve two masters. This is part of why &#8216;Afrikan-centeredness&#8217; often hasn&#8217;t been a sufficient designation for the quality of thought that is consistently of value toward producing Afrikan agency. As Dr. Ama Mazama has written, &#8220;the term African-centeredness&#8217; is clouded with confusion and would need to be defined by the many who use it, especially in free distribution with the term Afrocentricity&#8221;. An intellectual is an Afrocentrist or they are not.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>CHAPTER 3: CONCLUSION<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>&#8220;Consciousness precedes unity&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>~ Dr. Molefi Kete Asante<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Afrocentricity needs to be paired with systemic race consciousness. Race has had a central role in the construction of systems which have and still oppressed Afrikan people across the world for about the past 500 years. This is a significant detail of history, yet because of its persisting impact and influence over the lives of Afrikan and every other people across the world, we cannot simply move past the far-reaching implications that have been produced by the utilization of race without fighting through them. Knowledge of the origins of the racial construct may cause some to discard race and its accompanying logics as illegitimate. Race is a product of the European cultural ethos but it also primarily shapes the extant form of the US society. It can be quite dangerous to understand cultural identity as beyond racial identity. A systemic race consciousness coupled with concepts that are grounded in an Afrocentric historiography must be consistently applied throughout the logic of any ideology that is anti-racist, anti-European cultural hegemony.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Understanding that racist Europeans comprise the systems of interlocking institutions for white racial domination and continually produce ideological strategies of European cultural domination work in conjunction will optimize the capabilities of Afrocentrists to produce functional ideas which can be used to build functional responses.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Understanding that integration has perpetually failed is important moving forward. American society will never structurally integrate any critical mass of Afrikan people into itself because the Europeans that make up its composition have a vested interest in the maintenance of an apartheid state, though not nominally. Integration-ism has only resulted in the further integration of African minds with Eurocentric ideas and confusion. From a separatist disposition, Afrocentrists can clearly understand the relationship of the Afrikan &#8220;nation within a nation&#8221; to both the conservative and liberal wings of white supremacy. Understanding how these wings of white supremacy work in conjunction to maintain structural control over the systemic oppression of the Afrikan population is systemic race consciousness.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The historical account which displays the persistence of anti-black racism is evidence of the domestic context for why integration failed, but looking to a global and ancient context for how Europeans have been particularly jingoistic better frames the problems at hand. Not only was integration not achieved in the United States, should it even be an ideal for Afrikan people given the historical display of perpetual white antagonism? The inclination of Europeans to project their genetic insecurities on Afrikan people and fabricate their own pretexts to attack further emphasizes the necessity for Afrikan sovereignty.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">The conceptual dimension of white racial domination, Eurocentrism, is the mode of thought that is inseparable from the consequential racist behavior toward Afrikan people. Adoption of any aspect of this conceptual apparatus by Afrikan people, especially Afrocentrists, would be to further negate authentic expression of Afrikan agency toward the end of liberation. There are no black versions of European thought because thought is determined by culture not race. While race cannot be abandoned by Afrikan people in their struggle against white racial domination, Afrikan culture greatly enhances the conceptual nuances of the struggle. Afrocentricity is our greatest intellectual weapon and systemic race consciousness is an augmentation that will ideologically align us to optimize the functional utility of intellectual production that comes from the utilization of Afrocentricity.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY:<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\">Alexander, Michelle (2013).

Especially US media that has been highly touted as representing US Blacks. In fact, I enjoy a predominantly Whyte productions more. This could be a factor of 1930s popular psychology frameworks like &#8220;self-hate&#8221;. I personally sum it up as being tired of watching other Blacks worship representation that never amounts to more than symbols. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his &#8220;Die Nigger Die&#8221;, H. Rap Brown discusses &#8220;self-hate&#8221; from a perspective that is more praxis and less manipulative rhetoric. He makes a statement that US Blacks are &#8220;exposed to this country&#8217;s strongest institutions every day.&#8221; This exposure is not just programming from educational systems as H. Rap Brown addresses, but also from USA&#8217;s deeply entrenched media system.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That media entrenchment is not limited to presentations of Whyte USA, but also employs US Blacks and Afrikans of various nations to spread its messaging. This media system does not have to invent new forms of culture, as Jared Ball suggests in his work, &#8220;I Mix What I Like: A Mixtape Manifesto&#8221;, it only has to usurp and invade less empowered cultures.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In chapter&#8217;s one first section entitled,&#8217;The Colonized Rhythm Nation,&#8217; Jared Ball sets out to frame Hip Hop culture as a language and collection of artifacts worthy of designating its practitioners as a nation. He is not framing all US Blacks as citizens of this &#8220;nation&#8221;. Much of his usage of this framing is not to lift Hip Hop itself to a status, per se. His embrace of this framing of nationhood beyond territorial identifiers(land) is more to show Corporate America&#8217;s imperialist\/colonialist prowess.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is demonstrated in his own words when he writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The United States is often referred to as an \u201cempire,\u201d just as an ever expanding community engaged in various aspects of its elements is often referred to as a \u201chip-hop nation.\u201d But too rarely are the two concepts appropriately related. That is, if this nation is indeed an empire, it then proceeds from and is itself engaged in imperialism, or \u201cthe practice, the theory, and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory.\u201d Empire is also a \u201crelationship, formal or informal, in which one state controls the effective political sovereignty of another political society,\u201d and this can be arrived at \u201cby force, by political collaboration, by economic, social, or cultural dependence. Imperialism is simply the process or policy of establishing or maintaining an empire.\u201d And as an empire, its relationship to its own citizens and certainly other nations is one of colonialism. Empires create colonies, externally and internally as well. Within the U.S., whether Indigenous, Black, or Latino or the more popular, politically safer, and less racially-specific \u201chip-hop nation,\u201d all exist more as internal colonies as opposed to free and equal citizens. And therefore, interpreting them as such, while challenging to conventional wisdom, is far more appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;I Mix What I Like: A Hip Hop Manifesto&#8221;, Jared Ball, chapter one<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Father of Two, and Communications Scholar(*smiles*), Jared Ball presents a set of answers that also raised a few questions for me. I am one of those late seventies babies that embraced music as a lifestyle. Living in St.Louis, Missouri in 1980s meant you got your hip hop as an imported product. I heard Dana Dane over a dubbed cassette made by downstairs neighbor in our complex hallway when he came back from visiting his family on summer vacation. I sat outside Streetside Records while my older friends purchased cassettes with stickers that prevented me from purchasing directly. When me and a cadre of close childhood comrades came late to an EPMD signing at Vintage Vinyl in U City&#8217;s Loop, I ran up to their van and got an autographed poster anyway. Even in our adulthood, going out to concerts showcasing artists from Doug E. Fresh to Rick Rozzay casted lifelong friendship into memory. If there is a Hip Hop Nation, I am one of its indigenous natives.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That particular distinction does come with a set of defenses related to my dislike of much US Black media. Whenever a scathing critique of Black Twitter makes its viral rounds, those of us most associated with that labeling begin to question who is Black Twitter. In that same vein, I often question exactly who makes up this Hip Hop Nation that Jared Ball points to. Ever since I was younger, like pre-teens younger, there has been a going separation of hip hop fans and hip hop artists. That framework rests on a label of either &#8220;hip hop&#8221; or &#8220;rap.&#8221; A silly distinction that almost never explicates that most of Hip Hop post-1970s is commercially driven.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This defensive posture is probably mostly a result of Hip Hop&#8217;s enjoyment factor. Many will argue that Hip Hop stands as a vehicle for social messaging. This I do not disagree with, however, Hip Hop is party music. Hip Hop is a good time. Like much organic or grassroot artistic expression, it weaves a socially pleasurable technique with an awareness of social climate and texture. It is not Hip Hop&#8217;s fault that sex is as pleasurable an act to engage in as it is one to discuss over an 808 bass heavy beat. It is not Hip Hop&#8217;s fault that violence attracts our attention like a train wreck. Whatever commerical factors Hip Hop succumbs to, those elements most pointed out to distance one artistic expression from another have always existed in Hip Hop&#8217;s more nascent moments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is not Hip Hop&#8217;s commercial appeal, however, that makes it a target for usurpation. It is Hip Hop as a cultural artifict of a group of people that cannot defend it from outside Corporate interests that makes it an interesting resource. Jared Ball describes this dynamic when he states:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Empires do not deal with equally sovereign nations or citizens. Empires reduce nations (those both exterior and interior to themselves) to satellite client-states, which do not contain equally free sovereign people but at best \u201ccitizen-subjects\u201d who, even when born into a \u201cfirst world\u201d setting, are met by the \u201cintersections of race, culture, sex, gender, class, and social powers [that] are already locating in order to provide a particular space to hold [them].\u201d This allows for appearances of \u201cfreedom\u201d where \u201cgood citizens\u201d unconsciously \u201creplicate the social order and its hierarchizations, usually without the necessary imposition of directly brutal state force.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;I Mix What I Like: A Hip Hop Manifesto&#8221;, Jared Ball, chapter one<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Jared Ball cleverly, if not brilliantly, maps for us here is that relationship between extremely powerful entities and their only so powerful global neighbors. I do agree with some academics that Black Nationalist embrace of internal colony framing presents a few cavaets. What Jared Ball is doing, however, is presenting concrete and historically objective relationships beyond their abstract labelings. As he argues in this chapter, there are no land based distinctions for Empires, only rulers and resources. Whatever we call Hip Hop purists and fans, it is essential to understand that our cultural artifacts have been used because they are valuable. As an analysis, there are not many working frameworks outside of studies of settler and indigenous native that map well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jared Ball continues along this similar trajectory of thought:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&#8230;]regardless of whether we embark upon an analysis of rap music, or the entire \u201chip-hop nation,\u201d as being \u201clocated within a continuum of black cultural movements including the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s\u201d or \u201cthrough an evolution of African American musical production, with the blues, jazz, and R&#038;B as its predecessors\u201d or \u201cmapped diasporically as a point of convergence for African polyrhythms, Brazilian capoeira, and Jamaican sound systems,\u201d what cannot be avoided in any case is that it emerged as part of a pre-existing, and global, imperial process of colonization that had long been in full swing.69 The hip-hop nation is a colonized extension of a predating and continuing colonialism that engulfs its progenitors and governs still the process and necessity of the theft of soul or the grossest forms of distortion of communication.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;I Mix What I Like: A Hip Hop Manifesto&#8221;, Jared Ball, chapter one<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/black-media-trust\/douglas-rushkoffs-life-inc-history-exploitative-capitalism\/\" target=\"_blank\">In &#8220;Life, Inc&#8221;, Douglas Rushkoff<\/a> places capitalism along a historical trajectory with Royal commercial charters. These charters were crafted, not for growth of &#8220;free markets&#8221;, but so that powerful families could control how domestic markets were controlled, and how foreign resources where exploited. In many ways, Jared Ball envelopes elements of Black USA under a term that can explain developments similar to what Rushkoff attempts to point at. It is less about Hip Hop, more about domestic or indigenous resources being exploited and exported for gains garnered by elite powers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is difficult for me to enjoy US media.

She lived quietly on a farm in Iowa, raising horses and a daughter, until her husband died in 2006. Depressed and suffering from chronic pain, she started using methamphetamine. Unable to afford her habit, she and a group of friends started to make the drug, for their own personal use. She was arrested in 2012, underwent drug treatment, and has been sober ever since. She has never sold drugs for profit, but federal mandatory minimum rules, along with previous convictions for drug possession and livestock neglect, forced the judge to sentence her to ten years in prison. Each year she serves will cost taxpayers roughly $30,000\u2014enough to pay the fees for three struggling students at the University of Iowa.

It comes with certain assumption and prejudice, sure, but it belongs in a space of networks. We are given undue advantages based on superficial characteristics shared by members of a more powerful group. However, when privilege is being extended, I also make it my duty to put my notebooks to good use.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I find it difficult not to read certain racial codes into this piece. While I do believe in prison reform in some measure, I also believe prison reform in modern liberal space is US Whyte for &#8220;we are locking up too many of our own.&#8221; Albeit, I refuse to cut my nose to spite my face, there are a number of liberal measures that US Blacks can glean diminutive gains from. This does not, however, reduce what I believe is an intent to reduce class antagonisms within US Whyte ranks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That all be stated, I do find framing prison as a financial burden <i>interesting<\/i>, for lack of a better qualifier there. I have stated elsewhere, I am sure, that I find moral reasoning to be a bore. At some point, US Citizens must come full circle with their acceptance of what USA exactly is despite its wholly hypocritical yet lofty philosophical State&#8217;s Craft. In order to deal with a prison system that was always a double for slavery and free labor, an argument for tax payer&#8217;s being fleeced yet again must be spun to Whyte readers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>America passed the point of negative returns long ago. Its incarceration rate rose fivefold between 1970 and 2008. Relative to its population, it now locks up seven times as many people as France, 11 times as many as the Netherlands and 15 times as many as Japan. It imprisons people for things that should not be crimes (drug possession, prostitution, unintentionally violating incomprehensible regulations) and imposes breathtakingly harsh penalties for minor offences[sic]. Under \u201cthree strikes\u201d rules, petty thieves have been jailed for life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A ten-year sentence costs ten times as much as a one-year sentence, but is nowhere near ten times as effective a deterrent. Criminals do not think ten years into the future. If they did, they would take up some other line of work. One study found that each extra year in prison raises the risk of reoffending by six percentage points. Also, because mass incarceration breaks up families and renders many ex-convicts unemployable, it has raised the American poverty rate by an estimated 20%. Many states, including Mr. Sessions\u2019s home, Alabama, have decided that enough is enough. Between 2010 and 2015 America\u2019s incarceration rate fell by 8%. Far from leading to a surge in crime, this was accompanied by a 15% drop.<\/p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/leaders\/21722642-lot-known-about-how-reform-prisoners-far-too-little-done-americas-prisons-are\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Jail Break: America\u2019s prisons are failing.

While OWL will move on to address his doubts regarding technology as it exists in 2017 as this economic salve, there is something that needs to be addressed.

After it is about all those things, it is about a system design to promote failure and buttress a color-coded social stratification.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That being written, I would like to visit Robert McChesney&#8217;s &#8220;Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning The Internet Against Democracy&#8221;. In this book, he pens:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Political economy should be the organizing principle for evaluating the digital revolution for numerous reasons. The ways capitalism works and does not work determine the role the Internet might play in society. The profit motive, commercialism, public relations, marketing and advertising&#8211;all defining features of contemporary corporate capitalism&#8211;are foundational to any assessment of how the Internet has developed and is likely to develop. Any attempt to make sense of democracy divorced from its relationship to capitalism is dubious. Despite all of the routine assumptions equating capitalism&#8211;or its euphemism, free markets&#8211;with democracy, they remain distinct undertakings with very strong tensions that can boil over into direct conflict.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning The Internet Against Democracy&#8221;, Robert McChesney, pg 13<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He furthers his point and his criticism of capitalism further in his book when he puts this forth:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is only recently, as capitalism has floundered, that it has become almost mandatory to regard capitalism as permanent, irreplaceable, and benevolent. As recently as the 1960s and 1970s, when it produced golden-age results in America by today&#8217;s standards, it was more common to have frank, no-holds-barred discussions of the system&#8217;s merits and demerits. Gong back further, many of the great economists,<br \/>\n including John Stuart Mill and John Maynard Keynes, understood capitalism as a historically specific system, not as the eternal state of nature for humanity.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning The Internet Against Democracy&#8221;, Robert McChesney,pg 229<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Robert McChesney furthers his argument:<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;The capitalist system was able to thrive, on and off, during the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries,&#8221; Jerry Mander wrote in 2012. &#8220;But it&#8217;s now obsolete, nonmalleable, and increasing destructive.&#8221; Capitalism &#8220;had its day. If we care about the future well-being of humans and nature, it&#8217;s time to move on.&#8221; This is &#8220;radical&#8221; talk, but Mander, a former successful advertising executive, makes it clear that he is no socialist or Marxist. We are, in his view, at the point where we are dealing with an economy structured &#8216;to sustain the institutions and the people who sit at the top of the process.&#8221; The &#8220;system is bound to fail.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p>Capitalism has become what Mander terms &#8220;a kind of &#8216;third rail&#8217; of politics&#8211;forbidden to touch.&#8221; He acknowledges, &#8220;It remains okay to critique certain aspects of the system,&#8221; but the capitalist system itself &#8220;occupies a virtually permanent existence, like a religion, a gift of God, infallible.&#8221; The reason is obvious: those in power do not wish the system that makes them powerful to be questioned. Keeping capitalism off-limits to critical review is essential for that system, because it generates demoralization, disengagement, and apathy. This is not a political economy that can withstand much engaged political participation. To question the performance and suitability of really existing capitalism at a time when the world is falling to pieces does not necessarily make one an anticapitalist in some universal sense. It means one recognizes that a system that promotes poverty, inequality, waste, and destruction&#8211;to the point of making the planet uninhabitable&#8211;deserves no free pass from democratic interrogation in the present, whatever its past achievements.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning The Internet Against Democracy&#8221;, Robert McChesney, pg 228<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nearing his book&#8217;s conclusion, he succinctly poses:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;digital technologies may bring to a head, once and for all, the discrepancy between what a society could produce and what it actually does produce under capitalism. The Internet is the ultimate public good and is ideally suited for broad social development&#8230;Under really existing capitalism, however, few of the prospective benefits may be developed&#8211;not to mention spread widely. The corporate system will try to limit the technology to what best serves its purposes. Given capitalism&#8217;s track record and its corruption of the political system, we should not get our hopes up.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning The Internet Against Democracy&#8221;, Robert McChesney, pg. 227-228<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Politics and economics are intimately connected.

At root, this is a story of a business that fails in its unstated but aspirational profit objectives. Patrick begins this hero&#8217;s quest of sorts with language like &#8220;unjustly&#8221; homeless. That statement evokes and reinforces that wall around capitalism, that myth of Protestants of justly poor,<br \/>\n those Divinely sanctioned for life as slaves, peasants, paupers, prisoners, and homeless. It shows that his initial objective is less about helping others, more about raising someone to their proper position through this magic of code and business savvy. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While I do believe that Leo&#8217;s story removes much stigma surrounding homeless persons, I think it also fails to realize reasons why those stigmas, and homelessness, exists in these United States of America. No one high on any drug wishes for that intoxication to end. Most addiction is a form of chasing initial highs or greater ones. Power is a human high. It feels good to control others, to manipulate social conditions for one&#8217;s aims, to be acknowledged for such forays. All society is agreement. Capitalism(I really appreciate how McChesney words it,&#8221;really existing capitalism&#8221;) is a social contract that suggests some will be allowed to apotheosized above others for creating dams to resources we all contributed to amassing a surplus of in some means. Capitalism says to those like Leo, it is not your turn, and it may never be, despite whatever impetus Patrick&#8217;s of this society may actually be acting from.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I believe I became aware of this story sometime last year while scouring Youtube for tutorials and Medium.com for JavaScript framework complaints. &nbsp; &nbsp; Earlier this week, while waking up to feed my son, on my Youtube home screen, this video appeared: &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us please be clear.

In that collection&#8217;s eponymous essay, he writes of Dave Chappelle&#8217;s legendary departure from Comedy Central, leaving a highly touted $50 Million bag on that proverbial table. Comparing Dave Chappelle to Richard Pryor, he essentially hypothesizes that Dave Chappelle and Richard Pryor both transition from more &#8220;urban Black&#8221; forms of humor in front of Whyte audiences as a means of respecting that culture.  In that essay, I highlight Cobbs&#8217;s pertinent sentiment concerning Richard Pryor and Dave Chappelle&#8217;s respective &#8220;conversions&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pryor told the <b>New York Times Magazine<\/b> in 1975, &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a thin line between being a Tom and [depicting] human beings. When I do the people, I have to do it true. If I can&#8217;t do it, I&#8217;ll stop right in the middle rather than pervert it and turn it into Tomism. There&#8217;s a thin line between to laugh <b>with<\/b> and to laugh <b>at<\/b>.&#8221; That line was at the forefront of Pryor&#8217;s mind when he returned from Africa in 1979. He renounced his use of the word &#8220;nigger,&#8221; later saying in his autobiography that it was &#8220;a wretched word. Its connotations weren&#8217;t funny even when people laughed&#8230;It was misunderstood by people. They didn&#8217;t get what I was talking about. Neither did I.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p>Despite his later concerns, Pryor could get away with a skit like &#8220;Bicentennial Nigger,&#8221; in which a slave laughs about two centuries of bondage, rape, and lynching, because his 1976 audience understood the bitter indictment he was actually articulating. It would&#8217;ve been disastrous for the crossover Pryor of the 1980s to undertake that kind of sophisticated irony. The last skit Chappelle did before leaving the show was one in which a minidevil perches on people&#8217;s shoulders encouraging them to behave in stereotypical ways. In his case, the devil&#8211;who appears in blackface&#8211;convinces Chappelle&#8217;s character that he&#8217;ll be fulfilling a stereotype by ordering chicken on a flight. He dodges that trap by ordering fish, but the minstrel rejoices when learns it is catfish. The moral of the story is clear: Chappelle&#8217;s character lives in a catch-22 where anything he does fulfills some trait on an infinite checklist of stereotypes. It is a riff on the racial gymnastics required to negotiate the most routing of daily scenarios. Or it is a hilarious bit about a jigaboo dancing on an airplane. Depending upon who you&#8217;re talking to.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;The Devil &#038; Dave Chappelle, &#038; Other Essays&#8221;, William Jelani Cobb,<br \/>\n pg. 250-251<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In May of 2017, Dave Chappelle performed at a charity gala for New York City&#8217;s Robin Hood. Robin Hood is an organization that bills itself as &#8220;Targeting Poverty In New York City&#8221;. While its website did not help me much in understanding their mission statement, they do claim that they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.robinhood.org\/what-we-do\/metrics\">&#8220;wrote the book on smart giving&#8221;<\/a>. However, for our purposes here, Dave Chappelle&#8217;s comedic monologue is sufficient despite his audience&#8217;s somewhat mysterious identity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am including what appears to be a bulk of that routine&#8217;s video here.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><video width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" controls><source src=\"https:\/\/owlasylum.net\/[DaveChappelle]5_15_17__Robin_Hood_Benefit_2017.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\"><\/video><br \/>\n<cite>Dave Chappelle Performing At Robin Hood Charity Gala May 2017<\/cite><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dave Chappelle works in a world of narrative, satire, and stereotype. I consider one of Dave Chappelle&#8217;s comedic strengths his ability to include everyone in on a joke. Cobbs considers Richard and Dave&#8217;s work to be &#8220;inside jokes&#8221;, laughter aimed at others in an exclusive vernacular. I think differently. Dave Chappelle uses our othered counterparts as a mirror into our own ridiculous habits.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Take for example this routine&#8217;s introductory narration. Once again, mystery aside, but context matters. That is to say, his audience is a group of rich New York liberals that organize to end poverty in New York City. Dave Chappelle&#8217;s verbal skit, his narrative, is about a rich Black guy complaining about racism while living in luxury and spending exorbitantly while dodging a random homeless person. His story&#8217;s &#8220;moral&#8221; is a day of dealing with racism while enjoying shopping in upscale spaces and buying his homeless character a green velour Sean John outfit from Macy&#8217;s. He is not making fun of that homeless person; he is making fun of his audience via his own personage as narrator. &#8220;Making fun of&#8221; might be misinterpreted; I believe that metaphor of &#8220;holding a mirror up&#8221; to be a bit too self-righteous for Dave Chappelle&#8217;s brand, but it may work better to explain my thinking here.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do not think Richard or Dave Chappelle need to be so tied to stories with morals. This can be shown somewhat by Dave&#8217;s own parenthetical to his audience about his story going &#8220;nowhere&#8221;. However, as Cobbs notes, I do believe both funny men exist in a &#8220;damn if you do, damn if you do not&#8221; paradox. In that paradox, they both work using humor in self-deprecating ways. Pryor&#8217;s is much more direct, highlighting his own infamous literal self-destruction with recreational substances. Chappelle mentioning that his homeless counterpart is also a Vietnam veteran borrows heavily from that same tradition of public self-ridicule as personal growth that Richard was so instrumental in defining.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Dave Chappelle&#8217;s earlier work, he presented his viewing audience a series of skits entitled, &#8220;When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong.&#8221; These sketches had as premise a notion regarding consequences that might ensue when we attempt to abide by certain principles. Jelani Cobb interpreted this skit as:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The series &#8220;When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong&#8221; ridiculed the street ethics that have metastasized throughout black culture.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;The Devil &#038; Dave Chappelle, &#038; Other Essays&#8221;, William Jelani Cobb,<br \/>\n pg. 251<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I think those sketches were more of a reflection of that comedic genius that wrote and performed them.

Included along with Mr. Amiri&#8217;s own writing, <a href=\"https:\/\/imixwhatilike.org\/aboutimwil\/#jaredball\" target=\"_blank\">associate professor Jared Ball<\/a> and lecturer Todd Steven Burroughs compiled an assembly of critiques from renown active thinkers. As a conclusion and wrap up of this anthology titled,&#8221;A Lie Of Reinvention: Correcting Manning Marable&#8217;s Malcolm X,&#8221; Todd Steven Burroughs invites us to sit with him during a panel discussion as well a slightly fictional one in Malcolm&#8217;s Harlem. Before this, however, he takes us to roots as a journalist&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One day when I was lost, I discovered a Black writer by the name of Manning Marable. I was studying journalism, in a private, predominantly White Catholic university in the midst of the Reagan era, with the clear goal of one day writing for the <em>New York Times<\/em>.[&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p>[&#8230;]The New Jersey <em>Afro<\/em> carried the national <em>Afro<\/em>\u2019s opinion page, and I found there a column called \u201cFrom the Grass Roots\u201d and its weekly entry titled \u201cChallenge to Black Journalists.\u201d The author of the piece was Manning Marable.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Coda: Objectivity vs. Memory&#8221;, Todd Steven Burroughs, found in &#8220;A Lie Of Reinvention: Correcting Manning Marable&#8217;s Malcolm X&#8221;, chapter 20<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He goes on to quote a very ironic(hindsight has a sense of humor?) bit of writing from Manning Marable,\u201cThe white media generally refuses to admit that virtually all journalism is a form of \u2018propaganda\u2019 in the interests of certain political, economic and social class interests\u2014and that Blacks\u2019 interests never surface on that agenda&#8230;When we read <b><em>Le Monde<\/em><\/b>, does anyone doubt that we are encountering the interpretations of French journalists, with all the historical, cultural, and political baggage of that tradition? When we read <b><em>Pravda<\/em><\/b> and <b><em>Izvestia<\/em><\/b>, no one doubts that the perspectives of Soviet writers advance a particular view on society and politics. And when one reads the <b><em>New York Times<\/em><\/b>, everything from the selection of stories to the orientation of the editorials represents a type of bias towards the white corporate establishment&#8230;\u201d <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Todd Steven Burroughs&#8217;s fast forwards through time to after Manning&#8217;s death, a full stop making &#8220;Reinvention&#8221; grave marker and calendar highlight. Burroughs details a panel discussion composed of poetry luminary Sonia Sanchez, Manning&#8217;s lead researcher, Zaheer Ali, Peniel E. Joseph, and Herb Boyd. It is here that Burroughs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/marimba-ani-yurugu-logic-disharmony\/\" target=\"_blank\">reminds me of a sentiment expressed by Marimba Ani regarding western objectivity<\/a> as it is presented in journalism and academia. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strangely, that moment at the Harlem Book Fair felt like incidents I had read about in some of the media theory and criticism books I\u2019ve read and tried to understand. In those books, left-of-center media scholars write about how \u201cobjectivity\u201d limits the intellectual range of information given to the public. They argue that those who own and control the media only want an \u201cacceptable\u201d range of criticism aired and printed, with \u201cacceptable\u201d being defined by the owners and controllers themselves.[&#8230;] Were the Harlem Book Fair organizers and these panelists essential \u201coperators\u201d of a pre-determined, live, public, televised presentation of ideas? Were they doing to me, an openly harsh critic of Marable\u2019s <b><em>Malcolm X<\/em><\/b>, what African American political and cultural activists claim Whites in power have done historically, and still do, to them?<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Coda: Objectivity vs. Memory&#8221;, Todd Steven Burroughs, found in &#8220;A Lie Of Reinvention: Correcting Manning Marable&#8217;s Malcolm X&#8221;, chapter 20<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here Burroughs highlights our journalistic and academic weaponizing of &#8220;objectivity.&#8221; It is that same still method of creating an epistemological hierarchy that belittles&#8211;or demonizes&#8211; methods of truth presentation outside of modern hegemony. In this instance, it codifies any critic of contemporary academia as &#8220;backwards,&#8221; &#8220;uncivilized,&#8221; &#8220;unworthy&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Later, Burroughs borrows bits of each critique writer throughout his and Jared Ball&#8217;s assembly, forming his own response panel of sorts. All of these synopses deserve your immediate attention and diligent perusal, but I would like to visit what Burroughs writes of his Amiri.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Amiri Baraka:<\/b><\/span> Some of the characterizations in the book are simply incorrect and suffer from its author only knowing about the movement on paper.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Coda: Objectivity vs. Memory&#8221;, Todd Steven Burroughs, found in &#8220;A Lie Of Reinvention: Correcting Manning Marable&#8217;s Malcolm X&#8221;, chapter 20<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As meta of a writer as I may become(I am writing a review\/critique of a review\/critique of review\/critique), I must accept that there must be a standard set for who can say what. In that least part, there ought to be a set of parameters evoking immediate inquisition. Anything shy of that bar is simply pushing an agenda, resting very close to cowardice as one is talking behind a man murdered for his people as well as his beliefs in front of his family and city&#8217;s back with no care for apparent caution, and an abuse of authority.  Not above critique, just also worthy of a treatment of respect that is not beneath anyone&#8217;s humanity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Weaponizing objectivity without concern is antithetical to objective reality, which is supposedly that function western thinkers hold to as ideal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Around five years ago, I had that immense pleasure of sitting in on a lecture given by late and great Black Arts Movement parent, Amiri Baraka.

It is the site of the premeditated mass murder, the cold-blooded bombing of MOVE&#8217;s house, and the resultant mind-blowing massacre of at least 11 people, labeled &#8220;radicals.&#8221; Since this act of state-sanctioned incineration, a whitewash of major proportions and a witch hunt of survivors continues to this very day!<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Writing On The Wall: Selected Prison Writings Of Mumia Abu-Jamal&#8221;, Mumia Abu-Jamal, pg. 20<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n      On May 13, 1985, MOVE members took a principled and courageous stand, demanding freedom for their unjustly imprisoned family, and the city that claims to be the &#8220;cradle of liberty&#8221; responded by an act of absolute overkill that left many in mind of Vietnam&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Writing On The Wall: Selected Prison Writings Of Mumia Abu-Jamal&#8221;, Mumia Abu-Jamal, pg. 20<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a Rhodes scholar to figure out that the 1978 arrests, trial and convictions of nine MOVE men and women in connection with the death of a city cop was a setup from the word go. In a trial that had not even the faintest resemblance to justice, the judge who convicted them to a virtual millennium in prison would later boast over the airwaves of a popular talk-radio station that he had not &#8220;the slightest idea&#8221; who was guilty!<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Writing On The Wall: Selected Prison Writings Of Mumia Abu-Jamal&#8221;, Mumia Abu-Jamal, pg. 20-21<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Philadelphia&#8217;s response to MOVE&#8217;s righteous demand for freedom has echoed across the earth. During the much touted &#8220;summit&#8221; meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev, the threatened U.S.\/U.S.S.R. human rights &#8220;showdown&#8221; never materialized. Why not? Did the representative of &#8220;The American Way&#8221; forget? The Soviet news agency TASS offered a more apt reason: &#8220;American authorities recently gave the whole world a demonstration of their democracy when they publicly slaughtered more than a dozen black-skinned inhabitants of Philadelphia and bombed a whole city block.&#8221; This system&#8217;s propagandists (<i>Time<\/i> magazine) took the Soviet media to task for &#8220;omitting&#8221; the fact that Philadelphia&#8217;s mayor is Black, and, added <i>Time<\/i>,&#8221;The bombing has provoked much soul-searching in addition to searing criticism and lengthy hearings and investigations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did it matter that a &#8220;Black mayor&#8221; gave the OK that launched the bomb that blew Black bodies of women and babies asunder? Doesn&#8217;t South Africa show videos of its Black police flogging and flailing Black protesters? Are Black antiapartheid demonstrators any less maimed, bruised or broken because Black hands wielded the whips? If anything, it was not TASS that omitted pertinent facts surrounding May 13, but <i>Time<\/i> itself (and other U.S. media).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what of the &#8220;searing criticism&#8221; <i>Time<\/i> glibly boasts of? Can it produce one example of such criticism in its <i>own<\/i> back files? Apparently the alleged &#8220;soul-searching&#8221; <i>Time<\/i> wrote of was done in private, &#8216;cus it damn sure hasn&#8217;t been in print! One telling example of its &#8220;searing criticism&#8221; put the urban holocaust and firestorm of Osage Avenue into its &#8220;proper&#8221; perspective.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Goode insisted,&#8221; wrote <i>Time<\/i>, &#8220;that the fire, one of the worst in Philadelphia history, was simply the result of an accident, not bad judgment.&#8221; Neither <i>Time, Newsweek<\/i> nor any other U.S. newsmagazine elected to publish the critical comments of teenage survivor Birdie Africa, who said that when MOVE men, women and other children tried to flee 6221 Osage, they were repeatedly <i>driven back inside<\/i> a bombed and badly burning building by police automatic rifle fire.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Writing On The Wall: Selected Prison Writings Of Mumia Abu-Jamal&#8221;, Mumia Abu-Jamal, pg. 21-22<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither did America&#8217;s national newsweeklies feel it important to report that the military explosive C-4 (which composed part of the bomb) was a <i>gift<\/i> from an FBI agent to Philadelphia cops. Not one of them reported that the police were &#8220;loaned&#8221; machine guns and other weaponry by Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents of the Treasury Department of the U.S. federal government.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Soul-searchng&#8221;? &#8220;Searing criticism&#8221;? Bullshit! <i>Time&#8217;s<\/i> reference to &#8220;lengthy hearings and investigations&#8221; is little more than a smokescreen. Has <i>Time<\/i> yet given a definitive account of those hearings? Did <i>Time<\/i> cover the litany of lies that fell from official lips during those hearings? Did <i>Time<\/i> feel it necessary to report that, to date, <i>no one<\/i> has been fired, much less arrested in connection with this deadly disaster?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, did <i>Time<\/i> report that a federal investigation into the MOVE bombing was recently scrapped, because a Philadelphia Justice Department official decided evidence gained during the &#8220;lengthy hearings&#8221; was unusable&#8211;and thrown out? None of these facts proved newsworthy to <i>Time<\/i>, the magazine that dared to chide TASS for &#8220;omissions.&#8221; Meanwhile, U.S. mass media &#8220;omissions&#8221; continue.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who knows that MOVE members across Pennsylvania continue to be subjected to a wealthy of state-sanctioned harassment and deprivations, from denial of MOVE&#8217;s raw-food religious diet to MOVE people being thrown into the &#8220;hole&#8221; for refusing to violate their religion by cutting their hair? An unbiased review of MOVE trials show, unquestionably, that MOVE members languish in jail today essentially for being members of MOVE.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Case in point: this system&#8217;s prosecution of MOVE Communications Minister Ramona Africa. Romana, the only adult known to have survived the blistering May 13 inferno, braved a hail of automatic weapons fire, hundreds of thousands of gallons of water gushing through <i>her home<\/i>, numerous tear-gas grenade attacks, numerous explosive blasts against the walls of <i>her home<\/i>, emerging badly burned after the infernal aerial bombing of <i>her home<\/i>, only to be slapped with a deluge of charges upon her exit, among them simple assault, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering the public, threatening public officials and disorderly conduct.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Writing On The Wall: Selected Prison Writings Of Mumia Abu-Jamal&#8221;, Mumia Abu-Jamal, pg. 22-23<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember, not one public official, to date, has been charged with anything, even though they bombed a house full of men, women and children, blasted a city block to oblivion, blew the walls, fa\u00e7ade and roof off an occupied home, and <i>burned<\/i> men, women and <i>babies<\/i> alive. In short, the &#8220;City of Brotherly Love&#8221; committed a premeditated mass murder of MOVE people, and when one had the nerve, the gall, <i>the temerity to survive<\/i>, this city added insult to injury by bringing charges against her. Insanely, this system&#8217;s latest lunacy is to sue Ramona Africa and Louise James (whose son was murdered in the house) for monetary damages.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a remarkably detailed 25-page letter to supporters <i>and<\/i> reporters, Ramona described the city government&#8217;s rationale for the police overkill on Osage Ave. The stated justification for the assault was to serve past bench warrants for minor misdemeanor charges. That paltry reasoning falls flat on its face as Ramona documents how MOVE folks traveled freely across the city, shopping and even visiting other MOVE houses, until <i>days<\/i> before May 13. City claims of having been &#8220;afraid of contact&#8221; with MOVE, so as not to &#8220;inflame a tense situation,&#8221; seem similarly hollow in light of the beating and arrest of Mo Africa a block from MOVE&#8217;s house in July 1984, and his subsequent conviction on May 3, 1985&#8211;just 10 days before the bombing and razing of Osage Avenue. MOVE men, women and kids walked in city streets and played, ran and exercised in a nearby park until May 11, 1985.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Writing On The Wall: Selected Prison Writings Of Mumia Abu-Jamal&#8221;, Mumia Abu-Jamal, pg. 23<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Ramona&#8217;s own words,&#8221;If the authorities was interested in simply <i>arrestin&#8217;<\/i> MOVE people and bringin&#8217; us to trial on outstandin&#8217; litigation for alleged crimes, there was every opportunity for the authorities to do that as early as 1984, when MOVE people was walking the streets of Philadelphia alone or with maybe one other person, but the authorities were <i>never<\/i> interested in simply bringin&#8217; MOVE people to trial; they are <i>only<\/i> interested in stoppin&#8217; John Africa, and if killing us is the only way they see to do it, they are willing to kill us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As to what really happened on May 13, Ramona adds, &#8220;It is clear, to all those willing to see, that those cops did <i>not<\/i> come out on 62nd and Osage to simply arrest MOVE people; that could have been done anytime in 1984 if that was all Wilson Goode and those in authority wanted to do. Those cops came out to 62nd and Osage to <i>kill<\/i> MOVE people&#8211;men, women and babies&#8211;and to put anybody that survived their murderous attack in prison for the rest of their life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is past time for people to wake up to this campaign of state terrorism against the MOVE Organization, and to start speaking out against this obscenity of a system!

It is believed that an individualist society, in which the individual is thought to have a higher value than the group, tends to destroy groups that limit the individual\u2019s range of action, whereas a mass society negates the individual and reduces him to a cipher\u2026an individualist society must be a mass society because the first move toward liberation of the individual is to break up the small groups that are an organic fact of the entire society.&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Ellul&#8217;s framework, there is a need for an exclusive &#8220;better&#8221;(his &#8220;individuals&#8221;), and a mass of amorphous objects to be categorized and controlled(his &#8220;mass society&#8221;). Some might wonder why this is so. I believe Author of &#8220;Yurugu: An Afrikan-Centered Critique Of European Cultural Thought And Behavior&#8221;, Marimba Ani can offer some insight here. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>She writes in <i>Yurugu<\/i>:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any discussion of the nature and origin of European epistemology must focus on, if not begin, with Plato. This is not to say that he was not influenced by the pre-Socratic African philosophies that proceeded him. But what Plato seems to have done is to have laid a rigorously constructed foundation for the repudiation of the symbolic sense&#8211;the denial of cosmic, intuitive knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>[&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p>The dialogue the <i>Republic<\/i> is Plato&#8217;s ideological justification of the State he wishes to bring into being. What we witness in the dialogue can be viewed epistemologically as the creation of the object&#8230;.The acquisition of knowledge involving immersion in this universe until, through sympathetic participation, meaning is revealed, expressed, and understood via complex and multidimensional symbols. But in the &#8220;new&#8221; epistemology we exchange symbols for &#8220;objects.&#8221; The creation of the object requires a transformation of the universe, no longer experienced but rather, &#8220;objectified.&#8221; This transformation is achieved through a changed relationship of the knower to the known&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>        <cite>&#8220;Yurugu: An Afrikan-Centered Critique Of European Cultural Thought And Behavior&#8221;, Marimba Ani, pg. 30<\/cite>\n      <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Her initial assertion, along with historical qualification, works to establish an ideological center and fulcrum. While there are probably a number of other philosophers she could mention, her use of Plato does more for resonance, and Plato&#8217;s <i>Republic<\/i>(and <i>Cave<\/i> allegory) are templates of federated state rule, validations for social class organization and subsequent resource allocation, and existentialism as self versus self and every other entity from nature to family. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&#8230;]<br \/>\n        Two things occur, one effecting the other. First, the psyche undergoes a transformation: Slowly the &#8220;self&#8221; is perceived differently from before; then, the universe to which that self relates is perceived differently, because the nature of the relationship is changed. The self is no longer a cosmic being, instead it becomes &#8220;the thinking subject.&#8221; The Greek word <i>psyche<\/i> indicates an understanding of an autonomous self distinct from everything surrounding that self. The primary function of this self becomes the &#8220;knowing&#8221; and &#8220;thinking&#8221; of scientific activity, which is no longer connected to &#8220;intuiting.&#8221;&#8230;This new self becomes fiercely isolated from its environment. Why autonomous, distinct, and isolated? Because this &#8220;thinking being,&#8221; if it is to be capable of scientific cognition, must be, most of all, <i>independent<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>        <cite>&#8220;Yurugu: An Afrikan-Centered Critique Of European Cultural Thought And Behavior&#8221;, Marimba Ani, pg. 30-31<\/cite>\n      <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&#8230;]The success and appeal of Homer&#8217;s epic depended on the identification of the audience with the characters and plot.

They wait for white folks to tell them what to say. The tactic of media is to make you an enemy of the people. Enemies of the people are always vulnerable.

While in this chapter he does not mention any names, he does, however, blame negro media for responses to Malcolm X&#8217;s murder that may not have been as vitriolic as H. Rap would have expected. This leads to a major theme in this chapter vis-a-vis Whyte propaganda, or Whyte influence over Black spaces.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anything you don&#8217;t control can be used as a weapon against you. Education is used as a weapon against us. News media is used as a weapon against us. Athletics. We dominate in athletics, but we don&#8217;t control them. Therefore the negro athlete is used as a weapon against us. This country realizes that the athlete has an image in our community. So they get some ol&#8217; bootlicking, shuffling, money-mad negro, who can run or jump, and they tell him, &#8220;Go control your people. If we can&#8217;t control athletes, we can sure cripple &#8217;em.'&#8221; Brothers ought to break him up so bad, until he&#8217;ll to die to get well. The same thing goes for entertainers.

I do wish he had spent more time with that discussion. He does offer his solution to a problem that apparently extends even into my era. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another thing that is used effectively against Blacks is the court system. There is no justice in this country for Black people. Justice is a joke, and it stinks of hypocrisy. Lyndon Johnson is Hitler&#8217;s illegitimate child and J. Edgar Hoover is his half-sister. Justice means &#8220;just-us-white-folks.&#8221; there is no redress of grievance for Blacks in this country.

They were established as a result of the McCarran Act of 1950. There is a book called <i>Concentration Camps, U.S.A.<\/i> that&#8217;s written by Charles R. Allen&#8211;who is white. (I say this because it usually bridges the credibility gap; you don&#8217;t believe what Black folks say but you believe white folks.)

And &#8220;the man&#8221; shows it to you on t.v.

The Vietnamese and Latin Americans&#8211;america says that she&#8217;s in their countries to stop communist aggression. America has never moved to stop communist aggression in white countries by utilizing anti-personnel bombs and napalm; in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, she uses RADIO FREE EUROPE; never weapons of destruction. It is important to note here that all the countries with people of color are the ones militarily attacked by america. So why should we be immune to her racism? We experience it every day. We were brought here to do work, there is no more work. Machines do the jobs we used to do. The Attorney General made a statement a few weeks ago; it was interesting in this respect; he said, &#8220;Within 20 years the entire population of this country will be a leisure class, with the exception of ten percent of that population, because of automation and cybernation.&#8221; Then when we look to see who they are training for those jobs, we find that they are training whites.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg 139<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have not made any progress since we have been in this country.

Upon close examination, I find the thrust of most militancy is toward reform, not revolution. A militant in this case is one who never stops talking. Militants will bust their balls, campaigning to get some cracker elected. Black militants grow naturals to appear on t.v. as cops shooting blacks for this country. There is not one negro on t.v. that has a politically meaningful role: <i>I Spy<\/i> is the logical extension of <i>The Lone Ranger<\/i>; my man is just Tonto.

Rap Brown starts chapter eleven of &#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221; continuing his thoughts on revolutionary leadership. He addresses and defines who he considers true revolutionaries.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        Anybody who is projected as a leader generally impedes the revolution anyway. Whether I was out there or not, I knew that the brothers were going to take care of business. A revolution doesn&#8217;t depend on one person. In actuality, the revolutionary is an unknown person. He&#8217;s the brother who&#8217;s taking care of business, the one who&#8217;s getting his head together, the one who&#8217;s in the street, the one who dies in the rebellions. Like in Vietnam, he&#8217;s the one who is known only to his cell leader, or his commander. He&#8217;s the cat whose name never appears in history books. It ain&#8217;t the dude with the natural. I&#8217;d rather see a cat with a processed head and a natural mind than a natural head and a processed mind. It ain&#8217;t what&#8217;s on your head; it&#8217;s what&#8217;s in it. You see negroes with naturals on their heads and nothing on their minds. Revolutionaries are not determined by physical characteristics. Some of the most revolutionary people in Vietnam are women, but we got muthafuckas here running around talking about let the men do it all.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 111<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n      In his defining of revolutionary, he emphasizes unsung heroes.\n    <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        The news media is one of the greatest enemies to Black people. It is controlled by the ruling classes and is used to articulate their point of view. Every day the news media says,&#8221;The united states killed 2,000 Vietcong!&#8221; Hell, if you can count, it&#8217;s obvious that there can&#8217;t be no more Vietcong because the united states been killing them every day  by the thousands for four years now.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 120<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>  Here, H. Rap Brown addresses a perncicious authority given to US media outlets.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The media claims that I teach hate. Hate, like love, is a feeling. How can you teach a feeling? If Black people hate white people it&#8217;s not because of me, it&#8217;s because of what white people do to Black people. If hate can be taught, ain&#8217;t no better teacher than white people themselves. I hate oppression. I am anti anybody who is anti-Black. Now if that includes most white people in america, it ain&#8217;t my fault. That&#8217;s just the way the bones break. I don&#8217;t care whether or not white people hate me. It&#8217;s not essential that a man love you to live. But &#8220;the man&#8221; has to respect you.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 121<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown has consistently shown his inability to reduce his politics to a huggable moment. He is deeply aware of common misconceptions of US racial dynamics. His response to those that wish to box him in this &#8220;reverse racist\/angry Black man&#8221; category is that he does not care for their box, and while you are at it, here is a mirror. His humanity is not validated by seeking approval from Whytes like so many other Blacks supposedly doing &#8220;the work&#8221;. He does not seek to appease Whytes, not does he expect them to appease him.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe that america loves the negro, though. It loves for him to do its work,loves for him to stay down under its foot. But america does not respect negroes; negroes don&#8217;t respect themselves.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 121<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Using &#8220;america&#8221; as a metonoymy for US Whyte Supremacy, he underlines its proven objective of maintaining a racially coded system of class. Noting as well, this devotion of US Blacks to find their place within it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each individual Black person decides for himself whether or not he hates all whites. Racism in reverse is charged when Blacks don&#8217;t profess their undying love for whites.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 121<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap states a simple formula. For US Blacks, racial antagonistic attitudes are at an individual level. US Blacks do not have a collective or organized power structure to impose any systemic measures that makes their feelings anything more than an isolated occurrence. Blacks are held to a standard of racial tolerance that is not only hypocritical and illogical but also extreme.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Black Movement has never pushed the doctrine of racial superiority. But what upsets the media is that we don&#8217;t say we love all white people. White folks get up tight if the first words of a Black person say don&#8217;t deal with love. That&#8217;s their problem. If they haven&#8217;t been oppressing Black people then they ain&#8217;t got nothing to feel bad about.  <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 124<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown furthers this line of rationale by reminding history that US Blacks within his movement have not promoted a propaganda of scientific racism. His is not a campaign to reduce Whytes to animals like Thomas Jefferson did to Blacks, or to place them on an evolutionary trajectory that likens them to neanderthals like Charles Darwin did to Blacks. However, in his not creating more confusion based on racial competition and domination, he also does not see where it is necessary to &#8220;love&#8221; all Whyte people or any, for that matter. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>White people got hung up on integration. Segregation was the problem and the elimination of segregation was the solution, not integration. It was the unequal nature of segregation that Black people protested against in the South, not segregation itself. Separate but equal is cool with me. What&#8217;s the big kick about going to school with white folks? Them that want to do that should have the chance. But that ain&#8217;t no solution.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 124<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>He extends this notion with a quote from Franz Fanon:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fanon says of racism, &#8220;It stares one in the face for it so happens that it belongs in a characteristic whole: that of the shameless exploitation of one group of men by another which has reached a higher stage of technical development. That is why military and economic oppression generally precedes, makes possible, and legitimatizes racism. The habit of considering racism as a mental quirk, as a psychological flaw, must be abandoned.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 125<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown explicates his ideas regarding power structures and systems. Note his stance on Black leadership after power structures are usurped, while systems are left intact.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now there&#8217;re a lot of people who say that the way you change laws is to destroy the power structure. I say you got to go beyond that. If you destroy the power structure, it can always be replaced by another power structure, whether it&#8217;s white or Black. The power structure serves the system and the system is the thing which demands exploitation of people. You have to destroy the system. You can destroy the power structure and leave that system intact. But if you get the system, you got the power structure. That&#8217;s the job which confronts us.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 125<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once again, H. Rap Brown displays his political maturity. He reminds us that &#8220;liberation movements&#8221; must be directed by needs and pain points of those people a movement is supposedly directed to liberate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Liberation movements must be based upon political principles that give meaning and substance to the struggle of the masses of people, and it is this struggle that advances the creation of a people&#8217;s ideology. Liberation movements from the very beginning must be dedicated to the principles that speak to the needs of the poor and oppressed, or must evolve into this type of movement with these principles while the fighting is going on, for it is not evident that those who fight will assume power and implement decisions that appropriate the wealth of countries for all people. <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 128<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must draw from all ideologies those principles which benefit the majority of mankind. We cannot limit ourselves to just one concept or ideology that was relevant in some other revolution. As Debray point out, and correctly so, in his book <i>Revolution Within the Revolution:<\/i> &#8220;Revolutions cannot be imported nor exported.&#8221; Certain changes have made even some of the most advanced ideologies obsolete.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 128<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I broke this into two salient ideas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> Firstly, throughout this book his political breadth has widened. While I still feel his specific agenda is a US Black one, he embraces an all-encompassing revolutionary practice. He states &#8220;principles which will benefit the majority of mankind&#8221;. This infers a vision of revolution that is not limited to US Blacks in these United States. In fact, it also infers certain compromise in order to find those principles, that Summum bonum.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That second bit of thought I wanted to tease out here was his ability to disperse with particulars when they are no longer applicable. His is not a romantic or religious association with group political change. He also is not handcuffed to any set of solutions simply because they are from US Blacks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many people have had these principles (principles that speak to the needs of the mass of humanity) in mind as they were waging a struggle for independence, but having failed to win independence by defeating the enemy through armed struggle, it was necessary for them to negotiate with the colonial powers. In this process of negotiation, the colonial powers granted political autonomy but maintained economic influence, control, and investments. The mere act of negotiating freedom means that the control necessary to appropriate the entire wealth of the country did not fall to the new leaders. We should have learned by now from history that the process of negotiating freedom and not winning it by armed struggle has built-in limitations. We must be prepared to fight to the death to destroy this system known as capitalism, for it is this system that oppresses the majority of mankind.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 129<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As I pointed out above, H. Rap Brown has a singular focus that is not limited to one group of people. However, I do believe H. Rap Brown has a practical appreciation for local engagement. His central target is a system of oppression he frames as capitalism. Whichever methods necessary to attack and dismantle that system are determined by local variations and exploits determined by those people expressing pain due to that system of capitalism.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&#8230;]What is known as politics in this country is meaningless. People have been told that politics means the Democratic and Republican parties; federal, state, and local government; the vote. History shows that politics as it is defined by america is undesirable and dangerous to Black people, for the politics of capitalism has always been human oppression and exploitation. We must begin to relate to the politics of revolution. Chairman Mao says, &#8220;Politics is war without bloodshed and war is an extension of politics.&#8221; Every action that we are involved in is political, whether it is religious, artistic, cultural, athletic, governmental, educational, economic or personal. There is no seperation between church and state, art and politics, or politics and individual beliefs. Everything is inherently political. The only division occurs around the question of whose political interest one will serve.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 130<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown&#8217;s politics is abstracted in a similar manner as his revolutionary spiritualism. Sure, it is extremely pragmatic and rooted in empirical processes. It abhors absolutes, yet it embraces abstraction at that level of collective peoples. It is a politics that operates at local levels, while considers a global solution. With this sort of foundation, it is easy to understand how annoy H. Rap Brown must be in a nation where politics is reduced to media circus.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown scoffs at popular pronouncements and understandings of politics here in United States. This paragraph is not only him explaining his vision, but him laughing at those who define politics in this puerile bi-partisan manner.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Without a common Black political doctrine, america will use (and is using) Blacks against Blacks. Blackness must be political in our behalf. Individuals can no longer be immune to public political criticism because they are &#8220;Black and proud.&#8221; There must be revolutionary political criticism of counter-revolutionary positions and acts. Some individuals who gain popularity in Black america are later used as tools by white america. In most cases, white political interest comes as a result of the existing popularity of the Black individuals. Understand, popularity does not reflect correctness. Blackness alone is not revolutionary.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 130<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I agree with H. Rap Brown&#8217;s assessment that without a common, articulated, verbally agreed upon(as opposed to tacitly assumed) set of visions and outcomes, there will always be room for manipulation of US Blacks at a mass level. I totally disagree with any belief that this could ever happen, though.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Again H. Rap Brown explicates his disdain for fictive obligations in political space. Just because a person is &#8220;Black and proud&#8221; does not give them carte blanche from criticism. Their behaviors should still be examined; their motives and interests even more so. In H. Rap Brown&#8217;s revolutionary politics, racial fictive kinship is not a precursor for loyalty or accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we examine Cleveland, Ohio, Gary, Indiana, Washington, D.C., and many other areas populated predominately by Blacks we can see a tactic being used that has often been tried in Africa, Vietnam, and other oppressed countries. It is called neo-colonialism. In other words, when white structures and institutions are threatened whites protect their economic and political interests and maintain control by using members of the oppressed people as their spokesmen. They set up puppet governments headed by individuals with white interests in mind. These people oppress their own kind for their personal gain. These puppet leaders are as dangerous as those whom they represent.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 130<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is important that H. Rap Brown compares US Black celebrities being used to direct US Blacks for US Whyte interests to neo-colonialism. For years now, I have attempted to find a better term that speaks specifically to what occurs in Black USAmerica. That this particular tactic has not ceased in its malignant effectiveness from when H. Rap Brown wrote this to my era is very telling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>White folks realize now that they can concede Blackness and still exercise control. This country says, &#8220;Yes, you may be Black; but, you must be american,&#8221; which means we are as responsible for oppression as whites. This country says, &#8220;Yeah, you may have Black heroes; but, we must approve of them.&#8221; So, they publicize negroes who have been beneficial to this country.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 130<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here we see H. Rap Brown upbraiding US Blacks attached to this neoliberal machinery. H. Rap Brown determines that any Black allowed to represent Blacks at that nation media level must also be reflecting values of a capitalist state.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must say as Fidel Castro says, &#8220;No liberalism whatsoever! No softening whatsoever! A revolutionary people, a political people&#8211;a strong people&#8211;this is what is needed throughout these years&#8230;.What do the dangers or the sacrifices of a man or of a nation matter when the destiny of humanity is at stake?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg 131<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>H.

Rap Brown, pg. 103-104<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      I think it is important to address H. Rap Brown&#8217;s distress here. I am not sure how this book was written, but it definitely unfolds like a diary or journal. In its initial chapters, H. Rap Brown frames US Blacks in a very binary manner. As his experiences and thus praxis expands and is more informed, this worldview also alters. No longer is his stance on &#8220;Negroes&#8221; that sole fuel of his ire. We now see a more politically sophisticated and specific pain point being pronounced. There are members directly involved in &#8220;movement&#8221; space who despite whatever motives, are detrimental to that movement. While H. Rap Brown states in so many words that these persons talk too much, it is not his main concern. I think his more salient point here is that these persons do not have as central agenda those decisions and vision of those people they are representing.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        Half of the Black &#8220;militants&#8221; ain&#8217;t nothing but a bunch of potheads, bootleg preachers and coffeehouse intellectuals. They are caught up in that whole identity thing. They just discovered that they were Black, because they were working so hard all their lives to be white. They&#8217;re further away from being revolutionaries than the poor people who are not militantly political. But the coffeehouse intellectual, the Black militant, thinks he&#8217;s political because he reads Fanon. Books don&#8217;t make revolutionaries.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 104<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      It must be noted, H. Rap Brown writes this based on his direct involvement with personalities associated with 1960s activism and protest. His framework for critical assessment of movement types is now taking shape. Not only is every Black person not immediately a political ally, political allies with platforms must also be scrutinized heavily.\n    <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        [&#8230;]I contend that the Black people who burned down Watts and Detroit don&#8217;t have to read. These cats have lived more than the intellectual has read. So they are political by having learned from their existence. Oppression made these cats political. The militants spend all their time trying to program white people into giving them some money. &#8220;The man&#8221; has created a new type of Tom. They are wiling to be anything, as long as they can be Black first. Black capitalists, Black imperialists, Black oppressors&#8211;anything, so long as it&#8217;s Black first.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 104<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      H. Rap Brown furthers this here by defining &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; and &#8220;politically active&#8221; by one&#8217;s experiences, not simply what books one can quote. Throughout this chapter, his main theme centers revolutionary action as a process of people being self-determining, not leaders, or authorities dictating personal visions. I do not personally hold this same definition of &#8220;revolutionary&#8221;, but my definition does share his where it expresses a need of concrete direct action and engagement with state authorities(or those authorized by that state).\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      This last point addressed by H. Rap Brown is also pertinent. He includes in his definition of &#8220;negro&#8221;, thus &#8220;assimilists&#8221;, those involved in activism and protest spaces that are driven my identity politics. In his revolutionary ontology, those Blacks that are driven by a need to have Black representation and &#8220;Black firsts&#8221;, are also opportunists and assimilists.\n    <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>H.

Rap Brown explains how he and Ed always carried a gun. His anecdotal reasoning for his eye for an eye stance is simply his personal experience with law enforcement compared to others. He states that police never beat him as they were afraid of his retaliating even if only one person got back what they attempted to give him. He extends this philosophy of personal self-defense:\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        Everybody&#8217;s able to defend themselves, but few are willing. You got to be able and willing. That&#8217;s the whole concept. All my life that&#8217;s what&#8217;s been preserving me. And I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any need for me to change. Nonviolence might have been tactically correct at one time in order to get some sympathy for the Movement, but for me as an individual, it just never worked. And I didn&#8217;t try to convince myself that it would work.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite><br \/>\n        &#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H.

Rap Brown has framed &#8220;nonviolence&#8221; as a &#8220;tactically&#8221; applied measure, and not a hard coded philosophy. As US Blacks (especially Black males) are furthered molded in media as &#8220;savages&#8221;, whether literal animals or just criminally uncivilized, US Blacks in protest space seemed to fear any form of resistance that involves physical retaliation to physical onslaughts.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      H. Rap states that he had become acquainted with law enforcement harassing him and how his father had to bail him out of jail during Christmas. He details in length his being alienated from others due to his stance on carrying steal.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        Folks have always had difficulty trying to deal with the fact that I carry a gun. Even people in SNCC. The first time I got busted in Alabama, it was on a concealed weapon charge, and people in the Atlanta SNCC office wanted to know why I had a gun. This was in 1966 when SNCC was talking Black Power. They debated over whether or not to get me out of jail and they didn&#8217;t. Ed put up my bond. That was some shaky muthafucking shit. But I made it very clear to them. Yeah, I would give up my .38 when they gave me a laser gun. If <i>you&#8217;re<\/i> gonna woof at the muthafucka, then I&#8217;m gon&#8217; carry some shit to back up the woof. They could put me out of the organization, but they weren&#8217;t taking my gun. I knew that bubble gum and rocks ain&#8217;t no good against that other shit. The only thing &#8220;the man&#8217;s&#8221; going to respect is that .45 or .38 you got.

Rap Brown&#8217;s pragmatic approach to activism&#8211; especially in a group dubbed, &#8220;Student NONVIOLENT Coordination Committee&#8221;&#8211; creates a semantic contradiction in an effort to resolve a fundamental issue still facing US Blacks in public grievance.

A lot of people are mad at me now, because they say that me and Carmichael and other dudes who&#8217;ve been out there talking are only setting the stage for the extermination of Black people. Well, if 30 million people have to go to free the people in Vietnam and Africa, fuck it. We&#8217;ve been living too long anyway. Only people who&#8217;ve never lived fear death.

His stance on violence is deeply entrenched in personal survival, but it is also just as richly influenced by not only a local group sense of identity, or racial, but also a global identification with all oppressed peoples. This identification is not symbolic, but includes embracing concomitant corporeal sacrifice. He sees fear of death as an excuse to behave cowardly when faced with personal physical confrontation.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        [&#8230;]A lot of people say that it&#8217;s regrettable that Malcolm got killed. But Malcolm was not an individual. His life didn&#8217;t belong to him. No revolutionary can claim his life for himself. The life of the revolutionary belongs to the struggle. Malcolm, like Che, is not dead, because he was totally committed to the struggle. The only people who should make any kind of statement of regret over Malcolm&#8217;s death are Malcolm&#8217;s family. Death is the price of revolution. Malcolm assumed that responsibility and he knew what role he was playing. The shame is that the people who&#8217;re going around screaming Malcolm now wouldn&#8217;t listen to Malcolm when he was living.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 85<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>    As stated above, H. Rap Brown fully emerges us in his understanding of revolutionary intention. His is a revolutionary spirituality where those who pay that iron price are eternal energy and inspiration for those waging protracted physical struggle for oppressed peoples.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        Malcolm was the first Black leader to come out and tell Black people that they had a right to defend their own lives. Of course, it was negroes who needed to hear that, not Blacks. The brother on the block carried a knife in his diaper. He knew where it was at.      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 85<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      Malcolm X represents to H. Rap Brown a pioneer of US Black personal and group self-defense and right to bear arms. He does not frame Brother Malcolm as &#8220;loud and wrong&#8221; Black militant with empty rhetoric, but someone also willing to stand on those words.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        [&#8230;]America doesn&#8217;t rule the world with love. It rules with guns, tanks, missiles, bombs, the Army, Air Force, Navy and the Marines. When america fights a nonviolent war, I&#8217;ll become nonviolent. But I ain&#8217;t gon&#8217; hold my breath waiting for that day to come around. People want to say that I preach violence. If you&#8217;re minding your business and someone starts fucking with you, he&#8217;s being violent, because he&#8217;s infringing on your human rights. It&#8217;s your responsibility to jump back at the muthafucka and make him back down or fight.

Rap Brown, pg 75<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once again, I sense that thread of definition that weaves throughout this book. He touches on a topic that <a href=\"https:\/\/imixwhatilike.org\/2017\/04\/28\/the-myth-of-black-buying-power\/\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Jared Ball has written and curated research on<\/a>. Namely, this myth that one can purchase national liberation of an entire population of more than thirty million at time of H. Rap Brown&#8217;s writing. While I sense our limited options, I do believe it is foolhardy to phrase Black Banking, Black group economics, or Black financial security as a revolutionary tool or even radical. It is a survival mechanic, at best, and just another opportunist scheme marketed as &#8220;messianic measure&#8221; at its worst. H. Rap addresses it blatantly as a &#8220;hustle&#8221;, a con. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap describes Gaston Neals&#8217;s New School of Afro-American Thought organizing an arts festival in Washington, DC. According to H. Rap Brown, there was a Whyte right wing group, Voice of America, that apparently also received funding from same institutional authorities. Voice of America wished to video record Gaston Neal&#8217;s community program. H. Rap response:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let the muthafucking crackers tape nothing. They just wanted to use it as propaganda in Africa, to try and show how happy we all are with all this freedom and democracy they got here in this country, and we know that&#8217;s a crock of shit.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 76<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In our own times, I doubt most video footage of socio-political activity is utilized for such measure, but I definitely agree to overall sentiment here. Whether it is Instagram images, Twitter hashtagged images or protest b-roll, and even full blown theater distributed documentaries, there is probably always an ulterior motive for displaying public grievances against a state. H. Rap Brown deals with a much more pronounced propaganda. My present era, USA 2017, decades after repression, is a lot heavier with neoliberal, &#8220;go get the money&#8221; style socio-politics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his concluding pages of this chapter, H. Rap Brown relates his dealing with local police in this nation&#8217;s capital, District of Columbia. In his words, he was asked by police to join on a number of occasions. He was relentless in refusal. He addresses how working in those Black communities of Chocolate City(back when it still applied), gave him leverage to demand certain concessions even with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I went over there one other time to talk with this Captain about the police messing with some people. I told him that the community was about to explode if he didn&#8217;t do certain things. I told him that we&#8217;d unleash the people on his ass. So they started doing things like integrating patrol cars. It really showed me how much the structured feared our community and that the strength really lies in that community. The cops ain&#8217;t worth shit if a million muthafuckas decide to kick their ass&#8230;But we must understand that the cops are not the only problem. Cops serve the system, just like the army in Vietnam. The system allows cops to be what they are.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 78<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you have not read my highlights of Chapter One of H.

In fact, it is mellifluous in reading; vividly smooth in its expression.

Gwendolyn Brooks has presented us with Black girl and Black Woman as heroine of an epic prose.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Her &#8216;Alliad&#8217; wraps a social politic around a coming-of-age tale told in love ballads.

Rap Brown, pg 66<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown stays consistent with his framing of US Blacks as a dichotomy of anti-establishment &#8220;Blacks&#8221; versus assimilating &#8220;negroes&#8221;. In these sentences, H. Rap Brown is re-establishing a class relationship. He is reversing those roles, and responsibilities, normally associated with those on corners in context with those in colleges. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do have my disagreements with this approach. I do not think revolutionaries are bound by any moral, racial, social, or whatever-al motivations. For me, revolution is a purely political act defined and limited only by whether an actor successfully took control over a nation-state&#8217;s governing apparatus. I also do not promote a romantic perspective of poverty. I know people that will rob their own nephews for a five dollar shard of cooked cocaine. Structural mechanisms may make it difficult to avoid certain circumstances, agreed. But it also means my security is entrenched in being able to treat each individual as an individual, and respecting my right to choose who I obligate myself to regardless of race or class.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>College students, however, get caught in a trick, because they think that to be accepted by the young bloods, they have to be tough, be a warrior. But all they have to do is show that brother that they respect him and that they recognize that he is a brother. All Black people are involved in the same struggle. Revolutionaries are not necessarily born poor or in the ghetto. You don&#8217;t have to throw a Molotov cocktail to be a revolutionary. There is a role for every person in revolution if he is revolutionary.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg 66-67<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am once again conflicted by H. Rap&#8217;s words here. In one instance, it seems to be a healthy discussion of why Black essentialism should be shunned. Every Black person is not from a hood, and therefore does not have to carry themselves as one. Cool. However, there is also this counter thread extending through his overall framework that results in a false equivalence. Specifically, all Blacks that attend college are sheltered suburbanites that cannot defend themselves(Also that all Blacks from a hood can fight, but that&#8217;s probably more straw than even I am willing to pull at). I think it is necessary to qualify that more than just &#8220;Black college students&#8221; that are &#8220;revolutionary&#8221;. But, I do think it is healthy to establish a manifesto, if not mandate, for what Black education <i>could<\/i> do in spaces where brain drain from hoods is not a motivation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing which the Black college student can do is to begin to legitimatize the brother&#8217;s actions&#8211;begin to articulate his position, because the college student has the skills that the blood doesn&#8217;t have. It reminds me of the old story about the father and his son. The son comes to the father and says,&#8221;You told me that the lion was the king of the jungle. Yet in every story I read, the man always beats the lion. Why is that?&#8221; The father looks at the son and says, &#8220;Son, the story will always end the same until the lion learns how to write.&#8221; If you don&#8217;t begin to tell your own story, you will always be Aunt Jemima; you will always be &#8220;rioting.&#8221; You must begin to articulate a position of your own.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 67<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown presents yet another interesting intersection here. Yes, again, I write this while he is still asking college students to play a fictive and obligatory role. Yet, in his framing of that request, he is also suggesting a position of authority, and identity. As I have stated throughout my highlights of this book, there is a theme of definition that courses loudly, yet logically. Here, it is no different.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yes, OWL is hyper allergic to obligatory social schematics of kinship. But, I read this as one might an entente. H. Rap Brown addresses class antagonism&#8211; in which he not only writes with bias but writes with a prideful bias&#8211; by demoting <i>and<\/i> elevating those Black University students. Sure, this compromise is still hierarchical, obligatory, and romantic. I may come back to this at another date.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Aside from a lack of needed qualifications, I do agree with H. Rap Brown&#8217;s premise. He capitulates later in this chapter with:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The education that a Black college student gets will be irrelevant, fruitless, and worthless unless he uses it to define and articulate positions that are relevant to Black people.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H.

Rap Brown revisits his conceptual framing of Blacks and Negroes in United States of America. Within this framing, he also extends his theme of definition that we have found throughout this entire book.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biggest difference between being known as a Black man or a negro is that if you&#8217;re Black, then you do everything you can to fight white folks.<br \/>\n If you&#8217;re negro, you do everything you can to appease them. If you&#8217;re Black, you&#8217;re constantly in and out of trouble, because you&#8217;re always messing with &#8220;the man&#8221;. If white folks say it&#8217;s more cultured to whisper,<br \/>\n you talk loud. If white folks say gray suits are fashionable, you go buy a pink one. If they say america is great, you say america ain&#8217;t shit. Chairman Mao says, &#8220;Whatever the enemy supports, we oppose. Whatever the enemy opposes, we support.&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t read Chairman Mao when I was in high school, but I already understood that fundamental revolutionary principle.<br \/>\n I knew white folks couldn&#8217;t do wrong right, so whatever they thought was good, I knew wasn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 55 <\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I believe reading this out of context could provide a dangerous and simplistic justification for anti-intellectualism in US Black communities. I speak English. Regardless of whatever idiolect, dialeact, or sociolect my St. Louis upbringing wraps that language in, my mastery of this bastard tongue influences my social network. H. Rap here is not being that literal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> However, it can be difficult to delineate where behaviors stemming from a need to appease Whytes starts and ends in this social spectrum of USAmerican acculturation. What H. Rap Brown leaves us here with is a guide, similar to what I present in US Black Media Trust, that seeks to at least question why we might define one style as &#8220;high culture&#8221; as opposed to another style. He also offers us clear explanation for why some US Blacks adopt styles that are often presented as counter-culture or rebellious.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is from this crux that H. Rap Brown primes us for his anecdotal analysis of integration.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Integration was never our concern. In fact, integration is impractical. You cannot legislate an attitude and integration is based upon an attitude of mutual acceptance and respect between two racial or cultural groups in the society. A law can govern behavior, but attitudes cannot be forced or enforced, and what the Civil Rights Movement was concerned with was controlling the animalistic <i>behavior<\/i> of white people.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg 55-56<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I highlight this not only because it is crucial to this chapter, but also because it is data crucial to contextualizing what many of us simply romanticize. Without me linking to anyone&#8217;s poll, I do believe there are enough of us that share similar beliefs about integration&#8217;s limits, and psychological suggestions of Black inferiority. From an economic stance, integration has only worked to devalue US Black dollars even more than they already were. For someone deeply entrenched in organizing that involved tactics associated with integration to state that &#8220;integration is impractical&#8221; is refreshing and strategically rewarding.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In this chapter&#8217;s concluding paragraph, H. Rap discusses, and I have highlighted, United States Of America&#8217;s 36th President, Lyndon Baines Johnson specifically, and Democratic Party in general.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The anti-war movement now recognizes what Black people have learned. Johnson was elected in 1964 because he said that Asian boys (you dig him calling grown men &#8220;boys&#8221;?) should fight an Asian war. And Johnson got the biggest popular vote in american history and proceeded to fight the war like he was defending ol&#8217; ugly Ladybird from an attack. He did not recognize the popular vote. He recognized the Democratic Party. And it should be clear to all by now that there is no difference between the Democratic and Republican parties. There&#8217;s only one party in america and that&#8217;s the party of white nationalism. Both parties have made it clear that they will not tolerate dissent, it wouldn&#8217;t mean a damn thing, because dissent does not change policy. A hundred thousand people went to the Pentagon, and Johnson escalated the war. People took over the streets of Chicago and the Democratic Party nominated Hump the Dump. When the people cannot find a redress of their grievances within a system, they have no choice but to destroy the system which is responsible in the first palce for their grievances. The government is the lawbreaker. The people must become the law enforcer. We cannot allow the government to be an outlaw, particularly when the crime is against the people.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 62-63<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once again, it is important that someone who worked with those people that brought US Blacks to Democratic Party speak on illusive nature of USA&#8217;s two party politics. It is also necessary to that H. Rap Brown frames this analysis along with a set of fairly transparent examples of Democratic Party hypocrisies and opportunisms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Also highlighted here, is a reflection I have looked over in my past readings of this text. He states, and I quote again:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Both parties have made it clear that they will not tolerate dissent from Blacks or from whites. And even if they did tolerate dissent, it wouldn&#8217;t mean a damn thing, because dissent does not change policy. A hundred thousand people went to the Pentagon, and Johnson escalated the war.

Over a course of a little less than 48 years, they still are characteristic of modern Democratic Party policy towards its constituents. In 2008, US Blacks suffered from predatory lending that still impacts predominantly Black areas like metro Atlanta and Prince George&#8217;s County. In 2009, after historic support from this same bloc of voters, within Y&#8217;all&#8217;s Daddy Obama&#8217;s first 100 days(why is that so damn coveted anyway?) he signed a bill that would give those that harmed that same bloc of voters billions of dollars. A bill, mind you, that was originally crafted and unsuccessfully pushed by Republican President George W. Bush&#8217;s administration. In 2017, after disavowing everyone but Trump&#8217;s children, Hillary Clinton made a &#8220;suggestion&#8221; to bomb Syria, and guess what, GOP President Donald Trump launched missles targeting Syria.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Through both periods, college students, hackers, hicks, street niggas and opportunists branded in blue vests rallied, protested, and grievanced everything from College Tuition Hikes to Police Savagery, from Obama&#8217;s Birth Certificate  to Trump&#8217;s taxes.

He stated,&#8221;He studies human society as it is now and was in the past; and without either endowing humanity as a whole, or separate individuals, with superior qualities which they do not possess, he merely considers society as an aggregation of organisms trying to find out the best ways of combining the wants of the individual with those of cooperation for the welfare of the species.&#8221;<\/a> Much of what we see here written by H. Rap adheres to this sort of definition of authority and socially imposed hierarchy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If authority is to be used, it should not be a coercive type thing. After all,<br \/>\n what dictates that a person can be put in an authoritative position over someone else? If it&#8217;s experience, then respect should come from that, not authority. People should adhere to rules because they respect them and not because some position mandates that respect. Now if you raise a legitimate issue with a person and they respect it, then they&#8217;re gonna adhere to it. It&#8217;s like the principle of self-determination.

Rap Brown discusses through analysis and anecdote his thoughts regarding US Black collective self-defense. His notions of violence and defense not only include physical combat, but also envelope his ideas of wage labor and systemic psychological abuse.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He begins this chapter narrating an incident as a boy scout in Louisiana. According to him, he was shot with bb guns and ripped his uniform trousers while escaping. He was subsequently harrassed by a Whyte patroller during all of this. He decided he would take his chances at LSU where his Boy Scout Troop was meeting, torn pants and all. I quote his words:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I began to recognize then the value of being violent. I knew I hadn&#8217;t done anything to make them white muthafuckas shoot their B.B. guns at me, so I knew that the world didn&#8217;t run on love. The only thing that was gon&#8217; keep white muthafuckas off you was you!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The best example of that in the world today is america. America has made it clear that she respects only violence&#8230;America does not love China, but she refuses to move against China because she has the bomb. And all those troops. So what that means is that Black people have to address themselves to defending their communities and their homes, because if you can&#8217;t defend them, you can&#8217;t control them.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 37<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Without this seeming like some nod to &#8220;toxic&#8221; masculinity, I did find that last line compelling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;if you can&#8217;t defend them, you can&#8217;t control them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So often in socio-political literature, analysts and theorists find it difficult to link self-defense and self-determination. It tends to be easier for many in this space to associate &#8220;getting money&#8221; with political independence, but here, H. Rap is connecting one&#8217;s ability to ward off threat with one&#8217;s ability to govern and plan for future activity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He continues his thoughts regarding violence with:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Violence is accepted in america as long as it&#8217;s white folks doing it. Turn on the t.v. and you go deaf from all the gunfire. Let two fighters get in the ring and let neither one of them hit the other and see what the real savages out there are going to do. They&#8217;re going to scream for blood.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 38<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here, H. Rap connects power of definition with violence. I immediately thought of Whyte protesters violently attacking other Whyte protesters during <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/04\/15\/524122918\/protesters-use-april-15-to-demand-trumps-tax-returns\" target=\"_blank\">Trump Tax Release rallies<\/a> being as acceptable as Whyte hockey players mauling each other during games. When US Blacks are simply preparing for a protest, there is an immediate outcry for peace and a curtailing of violence even if it is violence against US Blacks being protested!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap resumes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So the question is not can Black people be violent. They send us to Vietnam and brag about what good fighters we are. It&#8217;s legitimate for a Black man to go over there and kill 30 Vietcong and get a medal, but you come back here and kill one racist, red-necked, honky, camel-breathed peckerwood who&#8217;s been misusing you and your people all your life and that&#8217;s murder. That&#8217;s homicide, because the white man has the power to define and legitimatize his actions. He can legitimatize violence. At this point we must adddress ourselves to defensive measures, something that will counteract that violence.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 38<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here H. Rap adds clarity. In Western society, social Darwinism and Machiavellianism are a fairly ubiquitous ontology. Robert Greene&#8217;s success with &#8220;48 Laws Of Power&#8221; is illustrative here. There is something to be said about one&#8217;s power to legitimatize violence and their ability to then legitimatize their humanity. As Fanon might write, there is a humanizing aspect to violence when one is able to define it as humane.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap invites a bit of Fanon in his thinking when he discusses violence as a unifying force. He states:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One significant thing about Detroit and Newark was that the violence created a peoplehood.<br \/>\n Black people had walked around under the illusion that they had a class system in the Black community. But the white man changed all that. He went in and beat &#8220;middle-class&#8221; as hard as lower-class Blacks. And &#8220;middle-class&#8221; Blacks were throwing as many fire bombs as the brother on the block. And afterwards, there was a real sense of community among the people, a real feeling of pride and togetherness&#8230;So a peoplehood was forced upon Black people, through white violence.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 39<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I think that last sentence should be altered some.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;So a peoplehood was forced upon Black people, through white violence,&#8221; should be changed to a peoplehood was consecrated among a group of Black people from various backgrounds because they chose to fight that Whyte violence back. That &#8220;peoplehood&#8221;, that fictive kinship, did not come solely through white violence, but at that price of active engagement against that hostile presence. There is a major difference there that I believe needs to be accentuated.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a segue from his discussion of direct conflict into a paragraph or more about intraracial classism, he begins to expound on institutional racism as a form of violence. Within this discussion, he points out how US Black Media is directed towards a neoliberalism as Black editors and decision makers seek to stall approval of Black direct actions unless a green light is given from a Whyte party. He writes<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of white america is a structure of institutions that says to Black people, &#8220;Nigger,<br \/>\n you ain&#8217;t shit.&#8221; All standards of excellence, beauty, efficiency and civilization are such that any comparison between Black and white is designed to favor white and put down Black.<br \/>\n And it&#8217;s ground into a Black person every minute of every day, whether you&#8217;re at work or whether you&#8217;re out trying to have some fun, it&#8217;s Nigger you ain&#8217;t shit.

He tells us of his father and grandfather. Recalling both of their work histories with Whytes, even of how his grandfather was veritably robbed as a sharecropper. He details his own work history, summarizing his experiences in this chapter&#8217;s last sentences:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do, but I&#8217;d found out what I didn&#8217;t want to be.

Rap Brown spends time addressing US Education as an institution of division and hierarchy establishment. He begins this argument by addressing individualism and territoriality in US Black spaces. H. Rap communicates:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Given the destruction by slavery of both tribe and culture, negroes create a new kind of american tribalism. A tribalism based on the exclusion of certain types. A deliberate attempt to make race a secondary consideration. There are tribes and tribes of negroes. The A.K.A. tribe, Kappa tribe, Doctor tribe, Teacher tribe, Entertainer tribe, High School tribe, College tribe, etc. This tribalism has extended into what is called the &#8220;Movement.&#8221; &#8220;Militant&#8221; tribes compete against other &#8220;militant&#8221; tribes and &#8220;moderate&#8221; tribes, to promote tribal interests and not the interests of the race or the masses. We treat revolution as if it is an historic process rather an evolutionary movement. In other words, we all got a monopoly on truth. Whites who consider themselves allies add to this by deciding which tribe is &#8220;correct&#8221; and which is &#8220;incorrect.&#8221; In other words, the one which best fits their needs.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 16<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>White folks get all righteous and wonder why Black people steal and gamble. Same reason white folks do. We need money, because the society says you must have it to keep from starving. If you got it, you eat. If you don&#8217;t, tough. But white people are able to make their stealing and gambling legitimate. White man&#8217;ll sell you a $20 suit for $50 and call it good business. What he actually did was steal $30. White man&#8217;ll buy a watch for $5.00 sell it for $49.95 and call the difference, profit. Profit is a nice word for stealing which the society has legitimatized.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 18<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In this chapter, H. Rap introduces a character from his past by way of anecdote. J.S., throughout this chapter, comes to symbolize those academically capable but underprivileged US Blacks that schools leave behind. In his own words, H. Rap explicates:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The teachers had to tell J.S. he was smart, &#8217;cause it was so obvious. But they made a point of letting him know that being smart wasn&#8217;t enough if your hair was uncombed, your clothes a little dirty, your skin a little ashy and your manners not the best. In other words, you may be smart,<br \/>\n but are black!<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 21<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This passage is pregnant like a rabbit with insights. Reading this not only reminded me of my own adolescence but also public treatment of <a href=\"https:\/\/gabrielledouglas.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gabrielle &#8220;Gabby&#8221; Douglas<\/a>. When she became Individual All-Around Champion at London&#8217;s 2012 Summer Olympics, Gabby was attacked for hair, not applauded for her achievements. Even in that realm of athletics, public opinion reduces Blackness to superficial appearance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap continues his discussion on US Education and US Blacks:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Education in america has to be viewed as propaganda machinery. All educational systems are propaganda machines, but for Black people, the american educational system is a propaganda machine we don&#8217;t need. It propagandizes against us. It makes us hate ourselves.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 21<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/jacques-elluls-propaganda-crowd-psychology-black-media-trust\/\" target=\"_blank\">We discuss noted scholar of propaganda, Jacques Ellul&#8217;s rules for propaganda<\/a>, and I believe H. Rap&#8217;s labeling here fits well into that framework.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He writes further:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Part of my mother&#8217;s whole attempt to make us a part of negro america was that she took us out of McKinley High and sent us to Southern High. Anybody who could pay $12 a year could go and that was for the activities card&#8230;it was really set up so the teachers at Southern wouldn&#8217;t have to send their children to school with Black kids. It was a crock of shit, but it had an air of &#8220;respectability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Busing Black children to schools outside the Black community is nothing but a move to divide the community. If integration is what&#8217;s wanted, then bus the whole community. But to take individuals out of the community is a very dangerous and immoral thing. The &#8220;brightest&#8221; students are taken, students who can fit into the white man&#8217;s program best, and they&#8217;re bused out the community so they can come back and articulate the white man&#8217;s program.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 21 &#8211; 22<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, not only is H. Rap defining this USAmerican Educational system as a propaganda machine because it &#8220;makes Blacks hate themselves&#8221;. He is also referring to how this system establishes a hierarchy of local level schools based on race. He shows how integration is less a process of social equality, but actually, another means by which US Blacks class themselves vis-a-vis a US Black collective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am one of those US Blacks that believes race is less important of a determination for loyalty than those you locally choose to be loyal to. Most of my considerations poured into US Black Media Trust is founded on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/black-media-trust\/black-race-based-fictive-kinship\/\" target=\"_blank\">my disdain<\/a> for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/black-media-trust\/3663\/\" target=\"_blank\">distant and unconditional race-based fictive kinship<\/a>. Just because two people find themselves living on same street or block does not make them &#8220;close&#8221; or &#8220;related&#8221;. I do, however, agree that if we are going to blatantly (as opposed to tacitly) group ourselves, then our schooling should be grouped as well. Any form of exclusiveness within our blatantly&#8211;that is verbally and not assumed&#8211; defined group is bound to create exclusion. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That said, I do believe that H. Rap is pointing more toward forms of Toxic Assimilation than blind fictive kinship obligations.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was always at odds with teachers. There are certain things in negro institutions that you have to do if you expect to make good grades and certain things you don&#8217;t do. One of those things is you don&#8217;t talk back.

Mr. James&#8217;s use of &#8220;negro&#8221; here is purely racial nomenclature, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/h-rap-browns-black-america-highlighting-chapter-one-die-nigger-die\/\" target=\"_blank\">unlike H. Rap Brown&#8217;s utilization as class based epithet<\/a>. As Kenan observes, Mr. James is a former student(of sorts&#8230;) of Richard Wright.

It should also be noted, of course, Mr. James has his own social and political attitudes to address in this piece.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His discussion weaves through <i>Native Son<\/i>, finding intricate and delicately nuanced symmetry with Ms. Lorraine&#8217;s <i>Raisin<\/i>. This leads his centerpiece topic, that one element that connects both stories, in his terms, &#8220;Negro American males&#8221;, with a particular focus on his &#8220;Negro woman&#8221; given Lorraine&#8217;s overall focus in <i>Raisin<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Of &#8220;Negro American Males&#8221;,  this honored scribe notes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is dangerous to be an American Negro male. America has never wanted its Negroes to be men, and does not, generally, treat them as men. It treats them as mascots, pets, or things. Every Negro woman knows what her man faces when he goes out to work, and what poison he will probably bring back. There is no guarantee that she will always be able to suck the poison out of him; the more particularly as the male&#8217;s aspirations, and his failures, are so thoroughly bound up with herself.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 26<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While this is written in 1961, although by a Gay American Negro male, it probably will need some qualifications to be palatable across climates of various temporal sensibilities. I am sure Mr. James&#8217;s sentiment here is regarding those US Black Women(&#8220;Every Negro woman&#8221;) who are involved with US Black men. Given a man of such renown insights, I find it difficult to believe he meant to overlook every other US Black Woman who do not wish to engage men romantically, in particular, or even just US Black men. That bit of courtesy aside, I do believe it is a powerfully apt statement, especially written in 1961. Even more so, from a vantage point 56 years out, where it still rings true. Privilege and toxicity, be damned, I am sure.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do think it is only fair to consider Mr. James&#8217;s words relating to this aspect of US Black sexual politics as it informs his analysis and critique of Ms. Lorraine&#8217;s <i>Raisin<\/i>. Even his thoughts on &#8220;the male&#8217;s aspirations&#8221; must be weighted by that auspice. He concludes this review of sorts with his own ruminations of that USAmerican middle class lifestyle, and USAmerican aspirations in general.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am not myself terribly worried about color TV and split-level houses, etc., since I consider my life to be already sufficiently compromised by the garbage of this century. My own rather melancholy feeling is that as long as people want these things, they will do everything in their power to get them; when they want something better, they will make it; all I can do in the meantime, it seems to me, is attempt to prove, by hard precept and harder example, that people can be better than they are. I see no point in railing against the American middle class as such. They are a pretty sorry lot, God knows, but they are suffering here in their tawdry splendor. What one has to do, I think,<br \/>\n is undermine the standards by which they imagine themselves to live. As for the rise of the Negro into the middle class, I am not certain that what is happening in this country can be summed up quite so neatly. It doesn&#8217;t look much like a rise to me; it looks more like an insane rout, with white people fleeing to the suburbs of cities, hotly pursued by Negroes. In any case, by the time anything we can comfortably speak of as a &#8220;rise&#8221; has occurred, this country will be, for better or worse, unrecognizable.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 27<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In &#8220;The Cross Of Redemption: Uncollected Writings&#8221;, edited by Randall Kenan, there is an essay, a review of sorts, written by James Baldwin.

Rap Brown, pg 1<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I highlight this passage because it reinforces my own beliefs that US Blacks will never be completely accepted as full-blooded national citizens. Every generation born poor will be met with aggressive state violence and criminalization or &#8220;toxification&#8221;. Each generation of US Blacks born in more privileged tax brackets and social environments will be left chasing &#8220;Firsts&#8221; and fighting for Civil Rights more about inclusion in exploitative markets than actual civility. To borrow from certain lore, there is this <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yakub_(Nation_of_Islam)\" target=\"_blank\">Yakubian Theory<\/a> of trajection at work. While I do not view Whyte Supremacy as this ontologically divine(or satanic), omniscient or omnipresent force, there is an objective reality of human history to be considered. If I am allowed to borrow from yet another body of myths, Herod would be hard pressed to keep up with number of bodies piled up from murders by police of Blacks from Kennedy to Obama.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Obama, my next quote from H. Rap describes how class in Black America is codified similarly to how Whyte America codifies all of its inhabitants: along a color\/nationality spectrum.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Race prejudice in america becomes color prejudice in negro america. That which is cultural prejudice by whites against Blacks becomes class prejudice in negro america. To distinguish themselves, negroes assign class distinctions. Here we find the instituting and substituting of parallel values. Negroes assume that what is good for white america is good for negro america.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid, pg 7<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He continues along this trajectory:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As they get more &#8220;educated,&#8221; their religion gets more like the white man&#8217;s religion as if their heaven will be segregated too. &#8220;Education&#8221; even extends down to the naming of the children. The more &#8220;educated&#8221; the negro becomes, the more European names he picks for his children&#8230;In other words, values are assigned to names. Names must now be more than functional.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid, pg 9<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While there is a clear difference between Donald Joseph and Barrack Hussein, it must be also noted there is a difference between Jermaine and Barrack in this particular discussion. There are societal perks for Blacks that can claim ties to nations or have obvious signs that they are not descendents of US Slaves. There are such creative naming traditions in communities of Blacks that are less influenced by Whyte hegemony that almost immediately class a Black person that other Blacks, immigrant or privileged class, attempt to disassociate themselves from.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap also extends his discussion on intraracial US Black classifications into socio-political and economic space with this addressing:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the white folks he works with ask him what he thinks about &#8220;the riot,&#8221; he says it&#8217;s hurting the cause and all sorts of bull like that. But that night after work, he breaks records getting home to watch it on t.v., cheering like a muthafucka the whole time.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid, pg 9<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It has to be noted here that this description could apply not only to late 1960s US Black America when it was written, but even to Obama Era USA.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Black america has existed ever since the first slave despised the injustice that was done to him and did not seek to accommodate himself to that injustice.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 11<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is a part of what might be considered his conceptual framework(I&#8217;m always calling something a conceptual framework, ain&#8217;t I?) for simplistically defining socio-economic stratas of US Blacks. In this chapter, he divides USA into Whyte America, Negro America, and Black America. I will immediately admit this is an unpolished study. I do appreciate him for at least tackling in a popular voice those coarse dynamics that envelope and define US Black America.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this book&#8217;s introduction, Ekwueme Michael Thelwell discusses H.

A strong tool, not best or only, but damn strong, in my box of techniques is cultural criticism applied to those held in sacrosanct spaces. At times, it can be difficult to pull down idols lifted to divine status from my position, so it is necessary to call upon other gods for assistance. Such a god for me today is James Baldwin.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Mr. James&#8217;s &#8220;Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough&#8221;, he offers a media critique of Otto Preminger&#8217;s 1954 musical film, &#8220;Carmen Jones&#8221;, that stars Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte. In this media critique, Mr. James demystifies this production and outlines its class bias and color coded symbolism of morality and amorality. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I quote at length when he writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And one is not allowed to forget for an instant that one is watching an opera (a word apparently synonymous in Mr. Preminger&#8217;s mind with tragedy <i>and<\/i> fantasy), and the tone of <i>Carmen Jones<\/i> is stifling: a wedding of the blank, lofty solemnity with which Hollywood so often approaches &#8220;works of art&#8221; and the really quite helpless condescension with which Hollywood has always handled Negroes. The fact that one is watching a Negro cast interpreting <i>Carmen<\/i> is used to justify their remarkable vacuity, their complete improbability, their total divorce from anything suggestive of the realities of Negro life. On the other hand, the movie cannot possibly avoid depending very heavily on a certain quaintness, a certain lack of inhibition taken to be typical of Negroes, and further, the exigencies of the story&#8211;to say nothing of the images, which we will discuss in a moment&#8211;make it necessary to watch this movie, holding in mind three disparate ideas: (1) that this is an opera having nothing to do with the present day, hence, nothing <i>really<\/i>, to do with Negroes; but (2) the greater passion, that winning warmth (of which the movie exhibits not a trace), so typical of Negroes makes <i>Carmen<\/i> and ideal vehicle for their graduation into Art; and (3) these are <i>exceptional<\/i> Negroes, as American, that is, as you and me, interpreting lower-class Negroes of whom they, also, are very fond, an affection which is proven perhaps by the fact that everyone appears to undergo a tiny, strangling death before resolutely substituting &#8220;de&#8221; for &#8220;the.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough&#8221;, James Baldwin, essay found in &#8220;Notes Of A Native Son&#8221;, pg. 50-51<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hold up, y&#8217;all, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge that sheer wit and grace that is Mr. James&#8217;s sarcasm here. My man legit wrote,&#8221;an affection which is proven perhaps by the fact that everyone appears to undergo a tiny, strangling death before resolutely substituting &#8216;de&#8217; for &#8216;the'&#8221;. My god, my god, my god!!! Alright, back to our previously scheduled programming&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He continues his reading of this work in this next paragraph. Here, he outlines how shades of skin hue are used to create a color-coded system for character morality. In his own writing:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A movie is, literally, a series of images, and what one <i>sees<\/i> in a movie can really be taken, beyond its stammering or misleading dialogue, as the key to what the movie is actually involved in saying. <i>Carmen Jones<\/i> is one of the first and most explicit&#8211;and far and away the most self-conscious&#8211;weddings of sex and color which Hollywood had yet turned out. (It will most certainly not be the last.) From this point of view the color wheel in <i>Carmen Jones<\/i> is very important. Dorothy Dandridge&#8211;Carmen&#8211;is a sort of taffy-colored girl, very obviously and vividly dressed, but really in herself rather more sweet than vivid. One feels&#8211;perhaps one is meant to feel&#8211;that here is a <i>very<\/i> nice girl making her way in movies by means of a bad-girl part; and the glow thus caused, especially since she is a colored girl, really must make up for the glow which is missing from the performance she is clearly working very hard at. Harry Belafonte is just a little darker and just as blankly handsome and fares very badly opposite her in a really offensive version of an already unendurable role. Olga James is Micaela, here called Cindy Lou, a much paler girl than Miss Dandridge but also much plainer, who is compelled to go through the entire movie in a kind of tearful stoop. Joe Adams is Husky Miller (Escamillo) and he is also rather taffy-colored, but since he is the second lead and by way of being the villain, he is not required to be as blank as Mr. Belafonte and there is therefore, simply in his presence, some fleeting hint of masculine or at least boyish force. For the rest, Pearl Bailey is quite dark and she plays, in effect, a floozie. The wicked sergeant who causes Joe to desert the army&#8211;in one of many wildly improbable scenes&#8211;and who has evil designs on Carmen is very dark indeed; and so is Husky Miller&#8217;s trainer, who is, one is given to suppose, Miss Bailey&#8217;s sugar-daddy. It is quite clear that these people do not live in the same world with Carmen, or Joe, or Cindy Lou. All three of the leads are presented as indefinably complex and tragic, not after money or rhinestones but something else which causes them to be misunderstood by the more earthy types around them. <\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough&#8221;, James Baldwin, essay found in &#8220;Notes Of A Native Son&#8221;, pg 51-52<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am not always sure what it is that makes multitudes of humans seek to glorify singular individuals.

My main concern at that time was with controlling against network effects. Fast forward seven or so years later, and I still hold to these thoughts. As a person that has operated several sites at one time, I realize that multiple domain names can be a heady task to generate content for on a regular schedule. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do, however, believe in that power of hyperlinks. Network effects is a nifty phrase that highlights social entropy. That is to say, people tend to continue their use of social sites they have built a network on as opposed to moving to other sites that are growing a network. This has created a dynamic whereby these users rarely click links(hypertext) leading outside of a domain name. Simply put, if a user is logged onto Facebook.com, most likely, they will remain on Facebook.com in some way. This phenomenon seems to occur exponentially when we factor in mobile apps. Today&#8217;s digital natives are kids in their favorite sandbox. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Legendary Ferguson activist and a long time cohort of mine, Bob Hudgins recently wrote a bit about this. I have also been reading Steven Johnson&#8217;s take on this in his book, &#8220;Interface Culture: How New Technology Transforms The Way We Create And Communicate&#8221;. In this work, Johnson compares hypertext usage in its superlative form as slang.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the mid-nineties battle over Ebonics taught us anything, it&#8217;s that the lexicon of popular idiom and slang is never quite what it appears to be on the surface. Colloquial speech gets a bad rap, but more often than not slang is where language happens. The influx of new terms and intonations keep the word-world lively.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Interface Culture: How New Technology Transforms The Way We Create And Communicate&#8221;,<br \/>\n Steven Johnson, pg. 106<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Johnson then begins to explain why he sees metaphors like &#8220;surfing&#8221; when applied to navigating hypertext as not only terrifically limited in analogy, but harmful.<\/p>\n<p>His words:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So it is with the verb <i>to surf<\/i> and all its variations: Web surfer, cybersurf, surfing the digital waves, silicon surfer: Not only are the iterations inane, but the concepts of &#8220;surfing&#8221; does a terrible injustice to what it means to navigate around the Web.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>What makes the idea of cybersurf so infuriating is the implicit connection drawn to television.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Surfing at least implied that channel-hopping was more dynamic, more involved, than the old routine of passive consumption. Just as a real-world surfer&#8217;s enjoyment depended on the waves delivered up by the ocean, the channel surfer was at the mercy of the programmers and network executives. The analogy took off because it worked well in the one-to-many system of cable TV, where your navigational options were limited to the available channels.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The links that join those various destinations are links of association, not randomness&#8230;A Web surfer clicks on a link because she&#8217;s interested.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 107-109<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Johnson then moves his attack from critics to Silicon Valley operators:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That success is a direct measure of the power and the promise of hypertext&#8211;all those links of association scattered across the infosphere&#8211;and yet most Web-specific start-ups have studiously ignored hypertext, focusing instead on the more television-like bells and whistles of grainy video feeds adn twirling animations.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 109<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Johnson is writing this in late 20th century perspective. While my hindsight on his shortsights is to be noted, it is quite noteworthy that even still in 2017, companies like Snapchat and Facebook are battling it out over dominance of video driven content.<\/p>\n<p>Continuing his praise of hypertext, he uses another symbol set borrowed from more grammatical spaces to frame them: punctuation. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The link is the first significant new form of punctuation to emerge in centuries, but it is only a hint of things to come. Hypertext, in fact, suggests a whole new grammar of possibilities, a new way of writing and telling stories.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But as a general interface convention, the link should usually be understood as a <i>synthetic<\/i> device, a tool that brings multifarious elements together into some kind of orderly unit.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 111<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>From this strategic position, he begins to lay down his arsenal of explanations regarding hypertext and link usage to define what Web can be:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Web should be a way of seeing new relationships, connecting things that might have otherwise been kept separate.

In a society, identity is a strong intoxicant. People wish to be given a program, a set of instructions with titles that inform them of how they should be behaving.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even those of us within more radical behavior spaces must ward against buying into programming that suggests how we should act and speak. United States of America is replete with rebels without a cause. We applaud passionate blindness that speaks in Marx but steps in Rockefeller.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Given our present media landscape is predominately networked and programmed interfaces, I thought it was necessary to return to some of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/black-media-trust\/douglas-rushkoffs-life-inc-history-exploitative-capitalism\/\" target=\"_blank\">Douglas Rushkoff&#8217;s writing<\/a>. In Rushkoff&#8217;s manifesto, &#8220;PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED: Ten Commands for a Digital Age&#8221;, he outlines ten rules to guide how media trust should be applied in online spaces. Each rule in his outline is fleshed out with practical reasoning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I quote at length here:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I. TIME<\/p>\n<p>Do Not Be Always On<\/p>\n<p>The spirit of the digital age still finds its expression in this reappropriation of time. Our cutting and pasting, mash-ups and remixes, satires and send-ups all originate in this ability to pause, reflect, and rework.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We work against the powerful bias of a timeless technology, and create a situation in which it is impossible to keep up. And so we sacrifice the thoughtfulness and deliberateness our digital media once offered for the false goal of immediacy\u2014as if we really can exist in a state of perpetual standby.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The results aren\u2019t pretty. Instead of becoming empowered and aware, we become frazzled and exhausted. We have no time to make considered responses, feeling instead obligated to reply to every incoming message on impulse. We reduce the length and complexity of our responses from paragraphs to sentences to txts, making almost everything we transmit sound like orders barked over a walkie-talkie in a war zone. Everything must happen right away or, better, now. There is no later. This works against the no-time bias of digital media, and so it works against us, even though it might work for the phone company programming the device and inducing our dependence and compliance. (Yes, each variety of beep is studied and tested for its ability to entrain our behavior.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yet this very discomfort and anxiety compels us to seek still more: The possibility of one great email from a friend, or one good contract offer somewhere down in that list of unanswered messages keeps us compulsively checking our inboxes, iPhones and BlackBerrys like classically conditioned gamblers at the slot machines.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the networking of the dendrites in our skulls that matters so much as how effective and happy we are living that way and, in the case of digital media, how purposefully we get ourselves there. Recognizing the biases of the technologies we bring into our lives is really the only way to stay aware of the ways we are changing in order to accommodate them, and to gauge whether we are happy with that arrangement. Rather than accepting each tool\u2019s needs as a necessary compromise in our passively technologized lifestyles, we can instead exploit those very same leanings to make ourselves more human.<br \/>\nOur computers live in the ticks of the clock. We live in the big spaces between those ticks, when the time actually passes. By becoming \u201calways on,\u201d we surrender time to a technology that knows and needs no such thing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>II. PLACE<\/p>\n<p>Live in Person<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While the intent of digital networks was not to disconnect a high school girl from her real world friendships, the bias of the networks were absolutely intended to favor decentralized activity. After all, the net was developed as a communications platform capable of withstanding nuclear attack. Messages\u2014whether text, audio, or video\u2014move through the network as \u201cpackets,\u201d each taking different routes from node to node until they find their destination. The network is still controlled centrally by an authority (we\u2019ll get to this later), but it functions in a decentralized way.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a result, digital media are biased away from the local, and toward dislocation. Just as television is better at broadcasting a soccer game occurring on the other side of the world than it is at broadcasting the pillow talk of the person next to you in bed, the net is better at creating simulations and approximations of human interaction from a great distance than it is at fostering interactions between people in the same place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Technology and media traditionally worked to make commerce more global, favoring big business over local interests. Mass production distanced workers from the value they were creating. Instead of making a product from beginning to end, each worker on an assembly line completed one small task in the overall process. The product moves from person to person\u2014or even nation to nation\u2014as it is assembled. Each person means less to the production cycle. One\u2019s skill level becomes less important as repeatable processes replace craftsmanship and expertise. Workers become cheaper and replaceable, while corporate pricing power puts local companies out of business. Towns become ever more dependent on foreign-owned factories for employment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mass-produced products require mass marketing to sell them. Instead of buying oats from Bob the miller, people\u2014now \u201cconsumers\u201d\u2014were to purchase them from a big company a thousand miles away in Ohio. The face of a Quaker on the package helped to re-create the kind of bond people used to enjoy with the fellow community members with whom they previously exchanged goods. Finally, a mass media arose to promote these long-distance brand images to an entire nation. Through radio and television, non-local companies could seed a market with their brands and mythologies before the package even made it to the shelf.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While cable television and, now, Internet marketing give smaller businesses a way to peddle their wares in the same media as their corporate counterparts, it may actually work against their real strength as real world, local companies. The power of a local business\u2014or any local enterprise\u2014is its connection to a particular region and people. Its locality is its strength. By turning to a decentralized medium to engage with people right around the corner, a local business loses its home field advantage. Its banner ads will never look as good as those coming out of a marketing agency anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This misguided tendency to depend on long-distance technology to enhance up-close encounters is completely understandable and forgivable. The more connected we feel in digital spaces, the less securely connected many of us feel in real ones. After days or weeks connecting with people through video chats, the sensation of someone\u2019s eyes actually looking into our own in real life can be overwhelming and disorienting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By recognizing digital media\u2019s bias for dislocation, we are enabled to exploit its strength delivering interactivity over long distances, while preserving our ability to engage without its interference when we want to connect locally. Many businesses\u2014particularly the biggest ones\u2014already exist in a non-local reality. The entire history of industrial corporatism, from colonial empires to the railroad barons of the nineteenth century, depended on disconnecting people from their local strength and commanding them from afar. For them, it is just as ridiculous to use the net to feign that they are local enterprises as it is for local enterprises to use it to act in the manner of national brands. Powerful global companies become weak local ones, while promising local companies become weak global players.<br \/>\nThe digital age offers us all the opportunity to recognize the dislocating bias of our interactive media. With that knowledge, we may choose when we wish to live and work in real places, with one another and\u2014unique to living humans\u2014in person.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>III. CHOICE<\/p>\n<p>You May Always Choose None of the Above<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We all want the freedom to choose, and the history of technology can easily be told as the story of how human beings gave themselves more choices: the choice to live in different climates, to spend our time doing things other than hunting for food, to read at night, and so on. Still, there\u2019s a value set attending all this choice, and the one choice we\u2019re not getting to make is whether or not to deal with all this choice.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s an online bookstore suggesting books based on our previous selections (and those of thousands of other consumers with similar choice histories), or a consumer research firm using kids\u2019 social networking behaviors to predict which ones will someday self-identify as gay (yes, they can do that now), choice is less about giving people what they want than getting them to take what the choice-giver has to sell.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Withholding choice is not death. Quite on the contrary, it is one of the few things distinguishing life from its digital imitators.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IV. COMPLEXITY<\/p>\n<p>You Are Never Completely Right<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to its first three biases, digital technology encourages us to make decisions, make them in a hurry, and make them about things we\u2019ve never seen for ourselves up close. Furthermore, because these choices must all be expressed in numbers, they are only accurate to the nearest decimal place. They are approximations by necessity. But they are also absolute: At the end of the day, digital technologies are saying either yes or no.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yes, thanks to the digital archive we can retrieve any piece of data on our own terms, but we do so at the risk of losing its context. Our knee-jerk, digital age reaction against academic disciplines finds its footing in our resentment for centuries of repressive hierarchies. Professors, gurus, and pundits made us pay for access to their knowledge, in one way or another. Still, although they may have abused their monopolies, some of the journeys on which they sent us were valid. The academic disciplines were developed over centuries, as each new era of experts added to and edited the body of what they considered to be essential knowledge. By abandoning the disciplines\u2014however arbitrarily they may have been formulated\u2014we disconnect ourselves from the multigenerational journey leading up to this moment. We are no longer part of that bigger project, or even know what it is we are rejecting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>This makes digital technology\u2014and those of us using it\u2014biased toward a reduction of complexity.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&#038;nbsp<\/p>\n<p>In the more immediate sense, facts devoid of context are almost impossible to apply sensibly. They become the fodder for falsely constructed arguments of one side or other of the social or political spectrum. The single vote of a politician is used to describe his entire record, a single positive attribute of caffeine or tobacco receives attention thanks to public relations funding, and a picture of a single wounded child turns public opinion against one side in a conflict rather than against war itself.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Both sides in a debate can cherry-pick the facts that suit them\u2014enraging their constituencies and polarizing everybody. In a digital culture that values data points over context, everyone comes to believe they have the real answer and that the other side is crazy or evil. Once they reach this point, it no longer matters that the opposing side\u2019s facts contradict one\u2019s own: True believers push through to a new level of cynicism where if the facts are contradictory, it means they are all irrelevant. The abundance of facts ends up reducing their value to us.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a result, we tend to retreat into tribes, guided primarily by our uninformed rage. And we naturally hunger for reinforcement. Television news shows rise to the occasion, offering shouting matches between caricatured opposites competing for ratings. Elected officials are ridiculed as \u201cwonks\u201d for sharing or even understanding multiple viewpoints, the history of an issue, or its greater context. We forget that these are the people we\u2019re paying to learn about these issues on our behalf. Instead, we overvalue our own opinions on issues about which we are ill informed, and undervalue those who are telling us things that are actually more complex than they look on the surface. They become the despised \u201celite.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Models are necessarily reductive. They are limited by design. This does not negate their usefulness; it merely qualifies it. Digital reduction yields maps. These maps are great for charting a course, but they are not capable of providing the journey. No matter how detailed or interactive the map gets, it cannot replace the territory.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>V. SCALE<\/p>\n<p>One Size Does Not Fit All<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>On the net, everything scales\u2014or at least it\u2019s supposed to. Digital technologies are biased toward abstraction, bringing everything up and out to the same universal level. People, ideas, and businesses that don\u2019t function on that level are disadvantaged, while those committed to increasing levels of abstraction tend to dominate. By remembering that one size does not fit all, we can preserve local and particular activities in the face of demands to scale up.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>On the net, everything is occurring on the same abstracted and universal level. Survival in a purely digital realm\u2014particularly in business\u2014means being able to scale, and winning means being able to move up one level of abstraction beyond everyone else. <\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Because the net is occurring on a single, oversimplified and generic level, success has less to do with finding a niche than establishing a \u201cvertical\u201d or a \u201chorizontal.\u201d Going vertical means establishing oneself as the place to do everything in a particular industry: the one-stop place for hardware, or cycling needs, or home electronics. Going horizontal means to offer a service that applies to every category\u2019s transactions&#8230;. In either case, \u201cscaling up\u201d means cutting through the entire cloud in one direction or another: becoming all things to some people, or some things to all people.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What all this abstraction does accomplish here on earth, however, is make everyone and everything more dependent on highly centralized standards. Instead of granting power to small businesses on the periphery, the net ends up granting even more authority to the central authorities, indexers, aggregators, and currencies through which all activity must pass. Without the search engine, we are lost. Without centrally directed domain name servers, the search engines are lost. Further, since digital content itself needs to be coded and decoded, it requires tremendous standardization from the outset. Far from liberating people and their ideas from hierarchies, the digital realm enforces central control on an entirely new level.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Activism means finding a website, joining a movement, or \u201cliking\u201d a cause\u2014all of which exist on a plane above and beyond their human members. Learning, orienting, and belonging online depend on universally accepted symbols or generically accessible institutions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Abstraction has been around since language, perhaps even before. Money, math, theology, and games would all be impossible without abstracted symbol systems, accepted standards, and some measure of central authority. The digital realm is no different in that regard.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>VI. IDENTITY<\/p>\n<p>Be Yourself<\/p>\n<p>Our digital experiences are out-of-body. This biases us toward depersonalized behavior in an environment where one\u2019s identity can be a liability. But the more anonymously we engage with others, the less we experience the human repercussions of what we say and do. By resisting the temptation to engage from the apparent safety of anonymity, we remain accountable and present\u2014and much more likely to bring our humanity with us into the digital realm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In a hostile, depersonalized net environment, identity is one\u2019s liability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The less we take responsibility for what we say and do online, the more likely we are to behave in ways that reflect our worst natures\u2014or even the worst natures of others. Because digital technology is biased toward depersonalization, we must make an effort not to operate anonymously, unless absolutely necessary. We must be ourselves.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t put words into the digital realm unless we are willing to own them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>VII. SOCIAL<\/p>\n<p>Do Not Sell Your Friends<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In spite of its many dehumanizing tendencies, digital media is still biased toward the social. In the ongoing coevolution between people and technologies, tools that connect us thrive\u2014and tools that don\u2019t connect us soon learn to. We must remember that the bias of digital media is toward contact with other people, not with their content or, worse, their cash. If we don\u2019t, we risk robbing ourselves of the main gift digital technology has to offer us in return for our having created it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Almost immediately after the first computer networks were developed for Defense Department use, their system operators noticed something strange: the scientists who had accounts were spending more time and bandwidth talking about their personal research interests and favorite science fiction novels than official business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While the Internet\u2014then Arpanet\u2014was a technological success, it had become overwhelmed by social use. The government decided to give it away. AT&#038;T turned down the offer to take it over. In what may have ultimately been a kind of wisdom, they couldn\u2019t see a business application for what appeared to be an academic social scene. The government ended up setting the net free, to a large extent, with the proviso that it only be used for research purposes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No one thought the net would end up going anywhere\u2014not least of which because people conversing with one another over networks seemed to be a financial dead end. The net was compared to Citizens Band radio\u2014a two-year fad that faded even before a movie about the truck drivers\u2019 lingo and culture could be shot and released. My own first Internet book was actually canceled by the publisher in 1992 because they thought the net would be \u201cover\u201d by 1993, when the book would finally hit the shelves.<br \/>\nThe social, noncommercial net continued to grow and grow. By 1994, studies showed that families owning a computer modem were watching an average of nine hours less television per week. Worse, at least to marketers, they were spending it in a completely commercial-free medium. Finally, after a series of violations by small businesses looking to promote their services online, the net was opened for commercial use. Legislators used the argument that it couldn\u2019t be held back effectively anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Friendships, both digital and incarnate, do create value. But this doesn\u2019t mean the people in our lives can be understood as commodities to be collected and counted. People are not things to be sold piecemeal, but living members of a network whose value can only be realized in a free-flowing and social context. We have yet to find out what that value might be.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Content was never king, contact is. Yet the possibilities for new levels of human connectedness and collaboration offered by networking technologies have hardly been tapped. We are too slow to realize that people are not a form of content\u2014a resource to be bought and sold; they are fellow cells in the greater organism of which we are all a part but are barely aware. We value our increased contacts for what they might provide and miss the greater value of the contact itself.<br \/>\nBut it is this contact, this desire to construct a social organism together, that has been the driving force of digital technology all along. The instinct for increased contact is the evolutionary imperative we feel to become something greater than ourselves. Just as atoms combined into molecules, molecules clustered into cells, and cells collected into organisms, we organisms are networking into greater levels of organization.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is the real draw of the many interactive devices we have brought into our lives. In a sense, the people dismissing the net as another form of CB radio had it right: We are still just finding novel ways of talking to one another. From the ridiculous faxes people used to send to each other containing lists of bad jokes to the tweets we now transmit by cell phone, each new communications technology provides a new excuse to forge connections.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The content is not the message, the contact is. The ping itself. It\u2019s the synaptic transmission of an organism trying to wake itself up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>VIII. FACT<br \/>\nTell the Truth<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>The network is like a truth serum: Put something false online and it will eventually be revealed as a lie. Digital technology is biased against fiction and toward facts, against story and toward reality. This means the only option for those communicating in these spaces is to tell the truth.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We all have relatives who mistakenly pass on ridiculous viral emails about corporations that will give a donation of a million dollars if you pass the email to others, or a kid in a hospital who needs a blood transfusion, or a threatening virus that will eat your data if you don\u2019t shut down you computer immediately. It\u2019s sweet that they want to share with us; it\u2019s just a shame they don\u2019t have anything real to share. Viral media fills this need for them, giving them fake facts with which to feed digital media\u2019s bias for nonfiction contact.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Those who succeed as communicators in the new bazaar will be the ones who can quickly evaluate what they\u2019re hearing, and learn to pass on only the stuff that matters. These are the people who create more signal and less noise, and become the most valued authorities in a digital media. But the real winners will once again be those who actually discover and innovate\u2014the people who do and find things worthy of everyone else\u2019s attention. They\u2019re the ones who give us not only good excuses to send messages to one another, but also real ways for us all to create more value for one another.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The way to flourish in a mediaspace biased toward nonfiction is to tell the truth. This means having a truth to tell.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IX. OPENNESS<br \/>\nShare, Don\u2019t Steal<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Digital networks were built for the purpose of sharing computing resources by people who were themselves sharing resources, technologies, and credit in order to create it. This is why digital technology is biased in favor of openness and sharing. Because we are not used to operating in a realm with these biases, however, we often exploit the openness of others or end up exploited ourselves. By learning the difference between sharing and stealing, we can promote openness without succumbing to selfishness.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>X. PURPOSE<br \/>\nProgram or Be Programmed<\/p>\n<p><i>Digital technology is programmed. This makes it biased toward those with the capacity to write the code. In a digital age, we must learn how to make the software, or risk becoming the software. It is not too difficult or too late to learn the code behind the things we use\u2014or at least to understand that there is code behind their interfaces. Otherwise, we are at the mercy of those who do the programming, the people paying them, or even the technology itself.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Instead of teaching programming, most schools with computer literacy curriculums teach programs. Kids learn how to use popular spreadsheet, word processing, and browsing software so that they can operate effectively in the high-tech workplace. These basic skills may make them more employable for the entry-level cubicle jobs of today, but they will not help them adapt to the technologies of tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Their bigger problem is that their entire orientation to computing will be from the perspective of users. When a kid is taught a piece of software as a subject, she\u2019ll tend to think of it like any other thing she has to learn. Success means learning how to behave in the way the program needs her to. Digital technology becomes the immutable thing, while the student is the movable part, conforming to the needs of the program in order to get a good grade on the test.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i> Programming is the sweet spot, the high leverage point in a digital society. If we don\u2019t learn to program, we risk being programmed ourselves.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Early computers were built by hackers, whose own biases ended up being embedded in their technologies. Computers naturally encouraged a hacker\u2019s approach to media and technology. They made people less interested in buying media and a bit more interested in making and breaking it. They also turned people\u2019s attention away from sponsored shows and toward communicating and sharing with one another. The problem was that all this communicating and sharing was bad for business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So the people investing in software and hardware development sought to discourage this hacker\u2019s bias by making interfaces more complex.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Fully open and customizable operating systems, like Linux, are much more secure than closed ones such as Microsoft Windows. In fact, the back doors that commercial operating systems leave for potential vendors and consumer research have made them more vulnerable to attack than their open source counterparts. This threat is compounded by the way commercial vendors keep their source code a secret. We aren\u2019t even to know the ways we are vulnerable. We are but to trust. Even the Pentagon is discouraged from developing its own security protocols through the Linux platform, by a Congress heavily lobbied to promote Windows.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Like the military, we are to think of our technologies in terms of the applications they offer right out of the box instead of how we might change them or write our own. We learn what our computers already do instead of what we can make them do. This isn\u2019t even the way a kid naturally approaches a video game. Sure, a child may play the video game as it\u2019s supposed to be played for a few dozen or hundred hours. When he gets stuck, what does he do? He goes online to find the \u201ccheat codes\u201d for the game. Now, with infinite ammunition or extra-strength armor, he can get through the entire game. Is he still playing the game? Yes, but from outside the confines of the original rules. He\u2019s gone from player to cheater.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Until push comes to shove and geopolitics force us to program or perish, however, we will likely content ourselves with the phone apps and social networks on offer.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For those who do learn to program see the rest of the world differently as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED:Ten Commands for a Digital Age&#8221;, Douglas Rushkoff(2010)<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Communication as a toy. &nbsp; Communication as a tool &nbsp; Communication as a weapon. &nbsp; It can be difficult to use a medium most used to not only present and promote stereotypes, but one that has for decades successfully sold stereotype as product.

In other words, the relationship governed by the interface is a <i>semantic<\/i> one, characterized by meaning and expression rather than physical force. Digital computers are &#8220;literary machines,&#8221; as hypertext guru Ted Nelson calls them. They work with signs and symbols, although this language, in its most elemental form, is almost impossible to understand. A computer thinks&#8211;if thinking is the right word for it&#8211;in tiny pulses of electricity, representing either an &#8220;on&#8221; or an &#8220;off&#8221; state, a zero or a one. Humans think in words, concepts, images, sounds, associations. A computer that does nothing but manipulate sequences of zeros and ones is nothing but an exceptionally inefficient adding machine. For the magic of the digital revolution to take place, a computer must also <i>represent itself<\/i> to the user, in a language that the user understands.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Interface Culture: How New Technology Transforms The Way We Create And Communicate.&#8221;, Steven Johnson,pg 14<\/cite><br \/>\n<\/quoteblock><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere I have discussed semiotics, culture, and race.

What are some differences in symbol representation that would be employed if same people that invented ragtime, blues, jazz, rock, and hip-hop also governed decision making over designs of software and computer hardware? If those design and technology leaders at XEROX PARC in 1960s and 1970s had all been influenced by either Dr. King, Jr, Malcolm X, Ella Baker, or Fannie Lou Hammer in an identitarian manner, what sorts of programs would have initially come with Apple and Microsoft&#8217;s versions of their work?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While I embrace a much more abstracted definition and understanding of interface that you can read here, I do understand exactly what Mr. Johnson is suggesting in this passage.

Given that I spent most of my life in an area I do not live in, those few lucky souls blessed to call me their friend have limited recourse to my time. That means I spend a considerable amount of time on phone calls making sure our bonds are secure.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, backstory out of our way, right? While on a call with one of my friends of over thirty years, I have mentioned him in a few pieces throughout Asylum&#8217;s history, an interesting topic of social mobility came up. There were some people advising him to &#8220;talk Whyte&#8221;. I was honestly flabergasted, but it did make me think of those millions of US Blacks in areas where performing race in a particular way is their only means of balancing inequality at their workplace. It put me in mind of a book entitled, &#8220;Acting White?: Rethinking Race in &#8216;Post-Racial&#8217; America&#8221;,  written by Devon W. Carbado and Mitu Gulati.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In their book&#8217;s prologue, they write:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> Decision makers\u2014whether voters, employers, law enforcement officials, or school admissions officers\u2014-implicitly or explicitly demand that African Americans work their identities to satisfy decision makers\u2019 racial expectations. Failure to work one\u2019s identity can result in losing elections, unpleasant and even deadly interactions with law enforcement, losing out on jobs, being passed over for promotions, and denial of admission to educational institutions. The disadvantages are not a product of simply being black. They are a product of how black a decision maker perceives a particular person to be. In this respect, what we describe is not so much an interracial discrimination problem (decision makers preferring whites over blacks) but rather an intraracial discrimination problem (decision makers preferring some blacks over others).<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Acting White?: Rethinking Race in &#8216;Post-Racial&#8217; America&#8221;, Devon W. Carbado and Mitu Gulati, pg 16<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In their first chapter, they explain their central artifact, &#8220;Working Identity&#8221;.<br \/>\n(Interestingly enough, this book&#8217;s first chapter opens with a description of a Dave Chappelle skit, &#8220;When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong&#8221;. Anyone who follows OWL&#8217;s Asylum, knows I really enjoy Dave&#8217;s work, and I think much of this success of Key &#038; Peele is due to their more racially palatable &#8220;Working Identity&#8221; as opposed to Dave&#8217;s less toned approach to his &#8220;Blackness&#8221;.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>From these authors we read:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As an initial matter, it is helpful to explain what we mean by identity. Nothing deep or philosophical. Th ink of identity as falling into one of two categories: sense of self identity (how we define and perceive ourselves) and ascriptive identity (how others define and perceive us). Admittedly, this distinction is artificial because how we see ourselves is shaped by how others see us. For example, a person\u2019s view of herself as outgoing, creative, and witty is based in part on other people experiencing her in those ways. Nevertheless, the distinction helps, if only because, at the end of the day, most of us do develop particular views of ourselves. We sometimes call this our self-image. While one\u2019s self-image can certainly change over time, at any given moment, we are likely to have one. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This chapter places these definitions of identity in the context of a broader discussion about race and professional identity in the workplace. We argue that because people of color often perceive themselves the subjects of negative stereotyping, they are likely to feel the need to do significant amounts of identity work to counter those stereotypes. What is worse, these stereotypes are often in tension with the institutional norms around which the workplace is organized. As a result of this tension, persons of color must master the ability to negotiate between their sense of self and their sense of who the institution wants them to be. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 24<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These authors use another term in their framing to discuss that act of compromising one&#8217;s principles in order to assimilate. They this &#8220;negotiation&#8221; and there is a subtle hint that they might be suggesting that &#8220;negotiating&#8221; one&#8217;s identity to curry favor is an appropriate course of going about. This reminds me of Marxist writer Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s prison notes regarding US Blacks assimilating as course for survival. (Gramsci also promotes this particular stratagem of assimilation as means to employ US Blacks to invade and extend neocolonialism to Africa.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do believe there is a danger in applauding assimilation. There is something akin to Stockholm&#8217;s Syndrome about a group of people who reward with titles like &#8220;Black Excellence&#8221; those members who given exclusive honors by institutions that uphold tenets of Whyte Supremacy simply in their defining standards based on elite Whyte tastes and collective aspirations. There is a danger in presenting assimilation as a viable option for reducing economic inequality.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For most people reading this, it should be known that I grew up in St. Louis, Misery.

Its purpose, from the beginning, was to suppress lateral interactions between people or small companies and instead redirect any and all value they created to a select group of investors.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;life inc: How Corporations Conquered the World, and How We Can Take It Back&#8221;, Douglas Rushkoff, pg 3<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>He spends a couple pages discussing roots of capitalism in 13th century merchant class extending trade for artisans while landed nobility shrunk. While this powerful, yet diminishing aristocracy provided military protection to vassals who governed peasants under Feudalism, they also watched as this growing merchant class developed international reach. He writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The aristocracy longed for a way to participate in the new economy&#8211;a way to invest that didn&#8217;t put them or their good names at any risk. For their part, the new merchant class had certainly increased the speed and breadth of wealth creation&#8211;but this also made for a highly competitiive and fluid business environment.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 5<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Continuing, he states&#8230;:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The division of labor is not the same thing as the specialization of labor. On the surface, it may appear that a society of merchants, managers, and various levels of laborers is more specialized than one of shopkeepers and artisans. But it was not to the manager&#8217;s advantages to hire highly specialized laborers who could demand higher wages. Instead, managers standardized processes in order to hire the least qualified and most replaceable laborers around.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>As the commercial economy spread, the peasant had to turn the only marketable skill he had&#8211;physical labor&#8211;into his means of survival. Evidence of this sort of wage labor can be traced all the way back to Portugal in 1253.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;both the aristocracy and the most successful of the mercantile class required a new mechanism through which they could invest their almost &#8220;generic&#8221; capital in the form of pure financial and legal power. This mechanism had to offer the ability to invest in a business with total discretion, anonymity, limited liability, passive participation, and little or no expertise.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional family businesses, which shared labor, risk, and capital by blood ties, were no longer sufficient to the task. New kinds of laws, contracts, and standardized currencies would be required to extend these agreements to people of different families and regions. Florence, with its key location on the Mediterranean (as well as its widely accepted currency, the gold florin), became the birthplace of the first &#8220;limited partnership&#8221; firms. the precursors to full-fledged corporations, they distinguished between the liability of the firm&#8217;s directors and of those who merely contributed capital, who would only be responsible for the amount of their contribution.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>As the operators of these huge projects sought to secure even more capital from a wider range of regions and social classes, they formed a more advanced form of limited partnership called the joint stock company, which could generate investment from shareholders on an open market. This broke business open, allowing for the creation of businesses by virtually anyone capable of getting investors.<\/p.\n\n\n<p>Finally, the monarchy had something it could offer the bourgeoisie who threatened to unseat them.<\/p.\n<cite>pg 6-7<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I discussed in another piece how capitalism is often defined in terms outside of its actual practical and objective history.

I come out of a black community where it was all right to have hips and to be heavy. You didn&#8217;t feel that people didn&#8217;t like you. The values that [imply] you must be skinny come from another culture&#8230;.Those are not the values that I was given by the women who served as my models. I refuse to be judged by the values of another culture. I am a black woman, and I will stand as best I can in that imagery.<\/p>\n<p><cite>Bernice Reagon, &#8220;Black Women And Liberation Movements&#8221; citing found in &#8220;In Search of Our Mothers&#8217; Gardens&#8221; by Alice Walker<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> Alice begins her piece with a visual. She takes our hands and apparates with us to December 1889. Van Gogh is writing a letter at a desk too small. She reads us his letter. Afterward, she explains why she has magically lifted us to this place:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Six months later, Van Gogh&#8211;whose health was &#8220;improving a great deal&#8221;&#8211;committed suicide. He had sold one painting during his lifetime. Three times was his work noticed in the press. But these are just details.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The real Vincent Van Gogh is the man who has &#8220;just done five size 30 canvasses, olive trees.&#8221; To me, in context, one of the most moving and revealing descriptions of how a real artist thinks. And the knowledge that when he spoke of &#8220;suffering under an absolute lack of models&#8221; he spoke of that lack in terms of both the intensity of his commitment and the quality and singularity of his work, which was frequently ridiculed in his day.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The absence of models, in literature as in life, to say nothing of painting, is an occupational hazard for the artist, simply because models in art, in behavior, in growth of spirit and intellect&#8211;even if rejected&#8211;enrich and enlarge one&#8217;s view of existence. Deadlier still, to the artist who lacks models, is the curse of ridicule, the bringing to bear on an artist&#8217;s best work, especially his or her most original, most striking deviant, only a fund of ignorance and the presumption that, as an artist&#8217;s critic, one&#8217;s judgment is free of the restrictions imposed by prejudice, and is well informed, indeed, about all the art in the world that really matters.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 4-5<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Alice brings home her driving point for this introductory set of statements with:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is always needed in the appreciation of art, or life, is the larger perspective. Connections made, or at least attempted, where none existed before, the straining to encompass in one&#8217;s glance at the varied world the common thread, the unifying theme through immense diversity, a fearlessness of growth, of search, of looking, that enlarges the private and the public world. And yet, in our particular society, it is the narrowed and narrowing view of life that often wins.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 5<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Alice takes a step away from Van Gogh&#8217;s kiddie writing desk, transporting us to a university circuit reading. At this reading, she is asked to differentiate between US Black authors and US Whyte authors. Her initial internal response is balanced in an annoyed way. She considers her own thoughts regarding art and her view of written works as one story composed by many writers. She does, possibly to humor her inquirer, distinguish certain treatments of death and struggle observed in these writings based on racial distinctions.<\/p>\n<p>While she admits that her &#8220;comparison does not hold up in every case&#8221;, she cite two books that do work to assist her analogy of forms: <i>The Awakening<\/i>, by Kate Chopin and <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God<\/i>, by Zora Neale Hurston. She goes to explain how many in her audience were unaware of any of Zora&#8217;s work. It is, of course, Alice who resurrects Ms. Zora out of obscurity. Through this essay, she explains exactly that bit of US Black Woman&#8217;s conjuring occurred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So when I sat down to write my story about voodoo, my crazy Walker aunt was definitely on my mind.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But she had experienced her temporary craziness so long ago that her story had all the excitement of a might-have-been. I needed, instead of family memories, some hard facts about the <i>craft<\/i> of voodoo, as practiced by Southern blacks in the nineteenth century. (It never once, fortunately, occurred to me that voodoo was not worthy of the interest I had in it, or was too ridiculous to study seriously.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I began reading all I could find on the subject of &#8220;The Negro and His Folkways and Superstitions.&#8221; There were Botkin and Puckett and others, all white, most racist. How was I to believe anything they wrote, since at least one of them, Puckett, was capable of wondering, in his book, if &#8220;The Negro&#8221; had a large enough brain?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Well, I thought, where are the <i>black<\/i> collectors of folklore? Where is the <i>black<\/i> anthropologist? Where is the <i>black<\/i> person who took the time to travel the back roads of the South and collect the information I need: how to cure heart trouble, treat dropsy, hex somebody to death, lock bowels, cause joints to swell, eyes to fall out, and so on. Where was this black person?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And that is when I first saw, in a <i>footnote<\/i> to the white voices of authority, the name Zora Neale Hurston.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 11<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Alice connects her introduction to this climatic device by writing:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I had discovered, of course, was a model. A model, who, as it happened, provided more than voodoo for my story, more than one of the greatest novels America had produced&#8211;though, being America, it did not realize this. She had provided, as if she knew someday I would come along wandering in the wilderness, a nearly complete record of her life. And though her life sprouted an occasional wart, I am eternally grateful for that life, warts and all.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 12<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I consider this piece of spellbound inspiration a testament to that power of will expressed through artistic medium. Two nodes very disconnected in time and space, or spacetime, joined by several well spliced strands. An artist sick of life, yet full of creative gifts who chooses to put a period on it without his own works given much ado. Another artist whose travels extend to and fro Southern Florida and Harlem Renaissance, dying in squalor despite her stunning, shining storytelling.

In that piece, I quoted an author, psychologist, and person responsible for coining that term, &#8220;groupthink&#8221;.<\/a> In his book, &#8220;Victims Of Groupthink&#8221;, Irving Janis lays out a set of definitions, a study of high-level policy makers in group decision making situations, and an overall framework to discuss groupthink as a factor of group dynamics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Janis selects four US foreign policy fiascoes to illustrate his hypothesis and framework for defining groupthink as an explanation for such displays of anti-critical thinking.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I use the term &#8220;groupthink&#8221; as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members&#8217; striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action. &#8220;Groupthink&#8221; is a term of the same order as the words in the newspeak vocabulary of George Orwell presents in his dismaying <i>1984<\/i>&#8211;a vocabulary with terms such as &#8220;doublethink&#8221; and &#8220;crimethink&#8221;. By putting groupthink with those Orwellian words, I realize that groupthink takes on an invidious connotation. The invidiousness is intentional: Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Victims Of Groupthink&#8221;, Irving L. Janis, pg. 9<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Janis continues his discussion by listing what he refers to as six major defects of decision making:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At least six major defects in decision-making contribute to failures to solve problems adequately. First, the group&#8217;s discussions are limited to a few alternative courses of action (often only two) without a survey of the full range of alternatives. Second, the group fails to reexamine the course of action initially preferred by the majority of members from the standpoint of nonobvious risks and drawbacks that had not been considered when it was originally evaluated. Third, the members neglect courses of action initially evaluated as unsatisfactory by the majority of the group: they spend little or no time discussing whether they have overlooked nonobvious gains or whether there are ways of reducing the seemingly prohibitive costs that had made the alternatives seem undesirable. Fourth, members make little or no attempt to obtain information from experts who can supply sound estimates of losses and gains to be expected from alternative courses of actions. Fifth, selective bias is shown in the way the group reacts to factual information and relevant judgments from experts, the mass media, and outside critics. The members show interest in facts and opinions that support their initially preferred policy and take up time in their meetings to discuss them, but they tend to ignore facts and opinions that do not support their initially preferred policy. Sixth, the members spend little time deliberating about how the chosen policy might be hindered by bureaucratic inertia, sabotaged by political opponents, or temporarily derailed by the common accidents that happen to the best of well-laid plans. Consequently, they fail to work out contingency plans to cope with foreseeable setbacks that could endanger the overall success of the chosen course of action.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 10<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A key point in his discussion is highlighted when he describes his initial findings. In this hypothesis, he points to a dynamic where loyalty to a group overshadowing critical thinking and objectivity in decisions made by that group lead to detrimental decision making by that group.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his own words:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;a dominant characteristic appears to be remaining loyal to the group by sticking with the decisions to which the group has committed itself, even when the policy is working badly and has unintended consequences that disturb the conscience of the members. In a sense, members consider loyalty to the group the highest form of morality. That loyalty requires each member to avoid raising controversial issues, questioning weak arguments, or calling a halt to softheaded thinking.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Paradoxically, softheaded groups are likely to be extremely hardhearted toward out-groups and enemies. In dealing with a rival nation, policy-makers comprising an amiable group find it relatively easy to authorize dehumanizing solutions such as large-scale bombings. An affable group of government officials is unlikely to pursue the difficult and controversial issues that arise when alternatives to a harsh military solution come up for discussion. Nor are the members inclined to raise ethical issues that imply that this &#8220;fine group of ours, with its humanitarianism and its high-minded principles, might be capable of adopting a course of action that is inhumane and immoral.&#8221;<br \/>\n<cite>pg. 12<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To his credit, Janis extends an enormous amount of energy in qualifying exactly what he wishes to point towards with his term, &#8220;groupthink&#8221;. That he attempts to establish this as early in his book fits within his overall tendency towards clarity. His work details readily that groupthink is not an attribute of individual error or structural error, that is, when it is a cause of error.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The concept of groupthink pinpoints an entirely different source of trouble, residing neither in the individual nor in the organization setting. Over and beyond all the familiar sources of human error is a powerful source of defective judgment that arises in cohesive groups &#8212; the concurrence-seeking tendency, which fosters overoptimism, lack of vigilance, and sloganistic thinking about the weakness and immorality of out-groups. This tendency can take its toll even when the decision-makers are conscientious statesmen trying to make the best possible decisions for their country and for all mankind.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 13<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Janis leaves us with his most resolute definition for groupthink:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>The more amiability and esprit de corps among the members of a policy-making in-group, the greater is the danger that independent critical thinking will be replaced by groupthink, which is likely to result in irrational and dehumanizing actions directed against out-groups.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><cite><\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is an attractiveness in using a term whose labeling is inspired by popular culture. However, there is a concomitant danger there as well. That being, a misuse based less on popular usage than lack of ever seeking to research context that gave impetus to its coinage. This is not OWL subscribing to practices of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vox.com\/videos\/2017\/3\/14\/14887560\/dictionary-english-kory-stamper-lexicographer\" target=\"_blank\">etymological fallicists<\/a>. Moreso, it is OWL bringing awareness to a framework that addresses that sort of anti-critical thinking that US Black Media Trust is specifically designed to tackle. While Janis applies his work in a way that poignantly averts any attempt at misusage, it ultimately gets misused, mainly because of how it sits in popular culture. However, his use of four high-level state department fiascoes is to make sure misreadings regarding what sort of group of individuals this phrase should be applied to do not creep into this framework.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For my usage here, it must be noted again that groupthink does apply to in person, high-level group decision making, mainly as a means of qualification. Groupthink is not used to consider group influence on people without power where class is a major determinant, as Janis uses government officials in military decision making criteria and members of one of Earth&#8217;s power nations. What I do believe I will ponder based on Janis&#8217;s study for my own work, is how people in groups formed purely in mediated space behave in similar fashion to those described in his studies of groupthink.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a number of factors, social elements, and internal dynamics of character that I could label as anti-critical thinking.

Baldwin, we find Kropotkin&#8217;s work entitled, &#8220;Anarchist Communism&#8221;. In this piece, Kropotkin lays bear his definition of &#8220;anarchist&#8221; in a manner to dispell misunderstandings as well as opponents of such ideology. He writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As to the method followed by the anarchist thinker, it entirely differs from that followed by the utopists. The anarchist thinker does not resort to metaphysical conceptions (like &#8220;natural rights,&#8221; the &#8220;duties fo the State,&#8221; and so on) to establish what are, in his opinion, the best conditions for realizing the greatest happiness of humanity. He follows, on the contrary, the course traced by the modern philosophy of evolution. He studies human society as it is now and was in the past; and without either endowing humanity as a whole, or separate individuals, with superior qualities which they do not possess, he merely considers society as an aggregation of organisms trying to find out the best ways of combining the wants of the individual with those of cooperation for the welfare of the species. He studies society and tries to discover its <i>tendencies<\/i>, past and present, its growing needs, intellectual and economic, and in his ideal he merely points out in which direction evolution goes. He distinguishes between the real wants and tendencies of human aggregations and the accidents (wants of knowledge, migrations, wars, conquests) which have prevented these tendencies from being satisfied. And he concludes that the two most prominent, although often unconscious, tendencies throughout our history have been: first, a tendency towards integrating labor for the production of all riches in common, so as finally to render it impossible to discriminate the part of the common production due to the separate individual; and second, a tendency towards the fullest freedom of the individual in the prosecution of all aims, beneficial both for himself and for society at large. The ideal of the anarchist is thus a mere summing-up of what he considers to be the next phase of evolution. It is no longer a matter fo faith; it is a matter for scientific discussion.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Kropotkin&#8217;s Revolutionary Pamphlets: A Collection Of Writings By Peter Kropotkin&#8221;, Edited By Roger N. Baldwin, pg 47<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In defending his stance for anarchist measures, or non-government, he reminds readers of how ineffective reform projects and policies were during his time:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Much hope of improvement was placed, of course, in the extension of political rights to the working classes. But these concessions, unsupported as they were by corresponding changes in economic relations, proved delusions. They did not materially improve the conditions of the great bulk of the workmen. Therefore, the watchword of socialism is: &#8220;Economic freedom as the only secure basis for political freedom.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Government has been submitted to the same criticism as capital.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 49<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Continuing his attack on pro-government sentiment, he aims at blind tradition while addressing flaws of state apparatus, when he pens:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The origins of government have been carefully studied, and all metaphysical conceptions as to its divine or &#8220;social contract&#8221; derivation having been laid aside, it appears that it is among us of a relatively modern origin, and that its powers have grown precisely in proportion as the division of society into the privileged and unprivileged classes was growing in the course of ages. Representative government has also been reduced to its real value&#8211;that of an instrument which has rendered services in the struggle against autocracy, but not an ideal of free political organization.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 51<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further in this essay, he picks up his chastisement of reform thinkers of his time. It should be noted just how similar these types of politically uninspired persons where to their modern day counterparts:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;the anarchist says to the political reformer: &#8220;No substantial reform in the sense of political equality and no limitation of the powers fo government can be made as long as society is divided into two hostile camps, and the laborer remains, economically speaking, a slave to his employer.&#8221; But to the state socialist we say also: &#8220;You cannot modify at the same time the political organization. You must limit the powers of government and renounce parliamentary rule. To each new economic phase of life corresponds a new political phase. Absolute monarchy corresponded to the system of serfdom. Representative government corresponds to capital-rule. Both, however, are class-rule. But in a society where the distinction between capitalist and laborer has disappeared, there is no need of such a government; it would be an anachronism, a nuisance. Free workers would require a free organization, and this cannot have any other basis than free agreement and free cooperation, without sacrificing the autonomy of the individual to the all-pervading interference of the State. The no-capitalist system implies the no-government system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 52<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While this essay will need a few articles for proper treatment, I will close with Kropotkin addressing opponents and those ignorant of his ideas of anarchism when they question him about morality in a society without a government:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;in the long run of the struggle for existence, &#8220;the fittest&#8221; will prove to be those who combine intellectual knowledge with the knowledge necessary for the production of wealth, and not those who are now the richest because they, or their ancestors, have been momentarily the strongest.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By showing that the &#8220;struggle for existence&#8221; must be conceived not merely in its restricted sense of a struggle between individuals for the means of subsistence but in its wider sense of adaptation of all individuals of the species to the best conditions for the survival of the species, as well as for the greatest possible sum of life and happiness for each and all, is has permitted us to deduce the laws of moral science from the social needs and habits of mankind. It has shown us the infinitesimal part played by positive law in moral evolution, and the immense part played by the natural growth of altruistic feelings which develop as soon as the conditions of life favor their growth. It has thus enforced the opinion of social reformers as to the necessity of modifying the conditions fo life for improving man, instead of trying to improve human nature by moral teachings while life works in an opposite direction. Finally, by studying human society from the biological point of view, it has come to the conclusions arrived at by anarchists from the study of history and present tendencies as to further progress being in the line of socialization of wealth and integrated labor combined with the fullest possible freedom of the individual.<\/p>\n<p>It has happened in the long run of ages that everything which permits men to increase their production, or even to continue it, has been appropriated by the few.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 53 <\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And finally, the injustice of our partition of wealth exercises the most deplorable effect on our morality. Our principles of morality say: &#8220;Love your neighbour as yourself&#8221;; but let a child follow this principle and take off his coat to give it to the shivering pauper, and his mother will tell him that he must never understand moral principles in their direct sense. If he lives according to them, he will go barefoot, without alleviating the misery around him! Morality is good on the lips, not in deeds. Our preachers say, &#8220;Who works, prays,&#8221; and everyone endeavors to make others work for him. They say, &#8220;Never lie!&#8221; and politics are a big lie. And we accustom ourselves and our children to live under this double-faced morality, which is hypocrisy, and to conciliate our double-facedness by sophistry. Hypocrisy and sophistry become the very basis of our life. But society cannot live under such a morality. It cannot last so: it must, it will, be changed.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 56<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I discussed in another article, Peter Kropotkin used essays that he transcribed into pamphlets as a means to extend his voice.

I ran across a line in one article that described Twitter accounts that are a hybrid of automation and human updating as &#8220;cyborg&#8221;. Now, as an adult who houses a younger self that once geeked out on Douglas Adams Dr. Who and such science fictions, this particular identification tickled me a bit. I probably fancied my Self more a mind reader of that Professor X lore than a cyborg, yet this reading did inspire me to consider those ways in which our forms of communication media extend our biological forms. This lead me to think of course about George Jackson&#8217;s thoughts on weapons as extensions of man, Marshall McCluhan, and without a doubt, Karl Marx. I also thought of some of history&#8217;s more influential pamphleteers such as Peter Kropotkin.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A collection of his pamphlets and articles turned into pamphlets during his life have been published in a book entitled and edited by Roger N. Baldwin,&#8221;Kropotkin&#8217;s Revolutionary Pamphlets: A Collection of Writings By Peter Kropotkin&#8221;. Contained within is an essay, &#8220;The Spirit Of Revolt&#8221;, in which is written:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are periods in the life of human society when revolution becomes an imperative necessity, when it proclaims itself as inevitable. New ideas germinate everywhere, seeking to force their way into the light, to find an application in life; everywhere they are opposed by the inertia of those whose interest it is to maintain the old order; they suffocate in the stifling atmosphere of prejudice and traditions. The accepted ideas of the constitution of the State, of the laws of social equilibrium, of the political and economic interrelations of citizens, can hold out no longer against the implacable criticism which is daily undermining them whenever occasion arises,&#8211;in drawing room as in cabaret, in the writings of philosophers as in daily conversation. Political, economic, and social institutions are crumbling; the social structure, having become uninhabitable is hindering, even preventing the development of the seeds which are being propagated within its damaged walls and being brought forth around them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;The morality of yesterday is today recognized as revolting immorality.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 35<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His writing is fairly poetic. Thankfully for its readers, it is a poetry of that better written variety. However, with poetry comes not only economy of words, but also romanticism. While Kropokin&#8217;s romanticism is less dainty, it being borne out of that bossom of a man in exile for much of his life, it does bear that lofty abstraction also known as &#8220;inspiration&#8221;. Although composed by an obviously read and intellectually trained person, it is also a writing that its writer understands must be consumed in short fashion. Yet, fluid, it is a writing that conjures images in an almost stacatto fashion. Yet, his insights are not reduced by his styling of them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His explicit highlighting of ideas as what drives dissatisfaction is a keen observation. As well as his treatment of moral obligations. There is an understanding here that society, as much of existence, is a dynamic state, and homeostasis is often a stagnant oppression where discomforts create potential chambers for combustion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In periods of frenzied haste toward wealth, of feverish speculation and of crisis, of the sudden downfall of great industries and the ephemeral expansion of other branches of production, of scandalous fortunes amassed in a few years and dissipated as quickly, it becomes evident that the economic institutions which control production and exchange are far from giving to society the prosperity which they are supposed to guarantee; they produce precisely the opposite result.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 36<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This passage above exposed for me much of that strength within Kropotkin&#8217;s composition. We are discussing a piece writting in 1880, that could easily be stated in regards to our present times. Whether this is a mark of those times&#8211; or a mark of ours&#8211; that his interpretation of his day&#8217;s economic structure in industrial Europe bear so much semblance to technocratic USA is brilliant. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Incapable of undertaking reforms, since this would mean paving the way for revolution, and at the same time too impotent to be frankly reactionary, the governing bodies apply themselves to half-measures which can satisfy nobody, and only cause new dissatisfaction. The mediocrities who, in such transition periods, undertake to steer the ship of State, think of but one thing: to enrich themselves against the coming <i>d\u00e9b?cle<\/i>. Attacked from all sides they defend themselves awkwardly, they evade, they commit blunder upon blunder, and they soon succeed in cutting the last rope of salvation; they drown the prestige of the government in ridicule, caused by their own incapacity. <\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 37<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here, I though Kropotkin&#8217;s almost complementary use of &#8220;reactionary&#8221; was noteworthy. In 2017, one typically does not find &#8220;reactionary&#8221; given honorable status, and yet, here we are. While, not to overlook his employment of characteristic, his ability to note that there is something of power in being reactionary as opposed to reformist. But, given that present state of Critical Theory that not only mutilates Marxism, but castrates it as well, this scale of power positions is refreshing, to say less than what might should be stated.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I suppose living in this age of Donald &#8216;The Don&#8217; Trump as US President, it would be remiss of me to not mention Kropotkin&#8217;s description of incompetence and ineptitude in office. His vision of maladroit statesperson&#8217;s at that helm of state authority solely to gather what is left of power is so reflective of my world in 2017, I chuckled against my other sentiments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a revolutionary situation arises in a country, before the spirit of revolt is sufficiently awakened in the masses to express itself in violent demonstrations in the streets or by rebellions and uprisings, it is through <i>action<\/i> that minorities succeed in awakening that feeling of independence and that spirit of audacity without which no revolution can come to a head.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In the midst fo discontent, talk, theoretical discussions, an individual or collective act of revolt supervenes, symbolizing the dominant aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Whoever has a slight knowledge of history and a fairly clear head knows perfectly well from the beginning that theoretical propaganda for revolution will necessiraly express itself in action long before the theoreticians have decided that the moment to act has come. Nevertheless the cautious theoreticians are angry at these madmen, they excommunicate them, they anathematize them. But the madmen win sympathy, the mass of the people secretly applaud their courage, and they find imitators. In proportion as the pioneers go to fill the jails and the penal colonies, others continue their work; acts of illegal protest, of revolt, of vengeance, multiply.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 39-40<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The direction which the revolution will take depends, no doubt, upon the sum total of the various circumstances that determine the coming of the cataclysm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>One party may have developed more clearly the theories which it defines and the program which it desires to realize; it may have made propaganda actively, by speech and in print. But it may not have sufficiently expressed its aspirations in the open, on the street, by actions which <i>embody the thought it represents;<\/i> it has done little, or it has done nothing against the institutions which it wants to demolish; its strength has been in theory, not in action; it has contributed little to awaken the spirit of revolt, or it has neglected to direct that spirit against conditions which it particularly desires to attack at the time of the revolution. As a result, this party is less known; its aspirations have not been daily and continuously affirmed by actions, the glamor of which could reach even the remotest hut; they have not sufficiently penetrated into the consciousness of the people; they have not identified themselves with the crowd and the street; they have never found simple expression in  a popular slogan.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most active writers of such a party are known by their readers as thinkers of great merit, but they have neither the reputation nor the capacities of men of action; and on the day when the mobs pour through the streets they will prefer to follow the advice of those who have less precise theoretical ideas and not such great aspirations, but whom they know better because they have seen them act.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 41-42<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is around these last two paragraphs that I begin to whip out my measuring stick of Black Media Trust and apply certain criticisms. Ferguson, Mo and Mike Mike Brown are never too far from my frontal lobes. I have a difficult time forgetting how often people calling themselves &#8220;activists&#8221; and &#8220;revolutionaries&#8221; disguised their self-aggrandizement and &#8220;safrice&#8221; behind this word,&#8221;actions&#8221;. If I do not hear or read &#8220;doing the work&#8221; ever again in my breathing existence, it would still be stated too many times to not be annoying to me. Something that Kropotkin lightly touches here but does not delve deep enough for me is this reality of individual or small group revolutionary success.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One point that I really put a lot of effort in driving home is this reality that change is spearheaded by small pockets of people with their own personal worldviews, paradigms, and weltanschauung. If it is ideas that cause dissatisfaction, it must be noted as well that each of these dissatisfactions are different among swaths of people no matter what identifying factors they share in common. Once power is established by any group of malcontents, their agenda will be enforce their particular visions despite what visions might be held by others with their shared identities. Once a victory is claimed, romantic notions of power transferrence need to be checks; that honeymoon is over.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have been reading a few articles and academic papers that detail social media bots and their patterns.

In it, he establishes an argument that much of our nation&#8217;s system of crime punishment was borne out of Rockefeller&#8217;s Drug Laws. Drug laws midwived by Black citizens concerned with growing heroin addicts, gang activity, drug peddlers, and criminality in their communities in general, he reasons.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his book&#8217;s introduction, he describes US Black leaders involvement with Rockefeller to establish these laws. This scene he illustrates takes place around 1973. I quote:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some were suspicious at the sight of African American leaders&#8211;civil rights activists and social reformers&#8211;promoting the patrician governor&#8217;s proposal to accelerate the imprisonment of young black males and expand a police state in Harlem. Black state senator Sidney Von Luther protested, &#8220;When he rounded up some ministers and other leaders to support him, he created a stacked deck; many of those people have gotten money from the Governor to run the very drug programs that have failed to solve the problem.&#8221; Woodrow Lewis, a black assemblyman from Brooklyn, lamented that Rockefeller had divided the black community by using these pastors as &#8220;[p]uppets and instruments in the creation of hysteria.&#8221; Lewis charged that the governor never consulted leaders who accurately reflected the desires of the city&#8217;s African American community. Even Joseph Persico, a Rockefeller aide and speechwriter, believed, at one point, that the governor had expertly manipulated some black ministers to engineer the passage of his drug program. In the proposal for his biography of Rockefeller, Persico wrote that the wily governor had called &#8220;in the chits&#8221; of Harlem pastors &#8220;whose churches had benefited from Rockefeller family bounty.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Black Silent Majority: The Rockefeller Drug Laws And The Politics Of Punishment&#8221;, Michael Javen Fortner, pg. 5<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am publicly one of those writers and thinkers that consider Black-on-Black crime a reality. That stated, I could not help but think of <a href=\"http:\/\/chicago.cbslocal.com\/2017\/02\/01\/donald-trump-ohio-pastor-chicago-gangs-violent-crime\/\" target=\"_blank\">US Black Trump supporters and their congregations claiming to have top gang thugs of Chicago&#8217;s ear<\/a>. Somethings never change, I suppose. Although, I do believe this scene painted for us here has a couple differing impetus. In today&#8217;s Mega Church, &#8220;Passing checks like Soros&#8221;, ambitious activist climate, it can be difficult to determine when an act is solely driven by profit motivations or from socio-political agenda. And as Fortner argues, it can at times be impossible in some minds to do one without doing that other.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Fortner also wishes to highlight is that timing of this policy change. According to his research, US Black leaders of that area had years of advocating for stronger laws and punishments for Blacks committing crimes, especially drug dealing, in Black communities. He notes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 1968, Roy Wilkins, the legendary leader of the NAACP, witnessed the toll crime was taking on African Americans and heralded the growing movement against it&#8230;By 1974&#8230;Roy Wood, a National Black Network radio commentator, urged a united effort in combating crime, saying,&#8221;I think when the criminal element of our communities becomes so bad and brazen that Black people are no longer safe on the streets&#8230;it is time to rally decent, self-respecting Black people together for nationwide action against Black on Black crime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In 1967, an African American business owner in Baltimore opined,&#8221;It&#8217;s been said that poverty is the cause [of crime], but many of us come from the ghetto, from poor homes and have not turned to crime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 8-9<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can be conflicted in discussions such as these. Contradictions will abound. There is a line where I cannot possibly support laws that are excruciatingly biased and teleologically determined to socio-economically deprive US Blacks of social mobility. There is a side of me that will always be dedicated to a religion of &#8220;Phukkk Them Police&#8221;. Also, there is a side of me that locks all his doors at night as a defense mechanism for his wife and child not to be harmed by other US Blacks. There is a side of me that installs alarms in his house located in a predominantly Black Baltimore neighborhood. I do exist at an interesting intersection of disenfranchisement and upwardly mobile professional Black middle-class existence. I have to weigh every case differently. Including my own on some days.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fortner weaves his study around these two polar sets of US Black social being. In one camp he admits that he speaks and represents a silent minority of Middle and Working class Blacks that seldom are represented in discussions of this nature. He also does a lengthy job of explaining how USA maintains unjust strata of incarcerated US Blacks. Continuing his discussion in this vein, Fortner explicates:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A curious thing happened after the Civil Rights Movement ended. Many African Americans, who had just won new freedoms, found themselves captured once more after the 1970s. Numerous young black men were caught in the throes of the modern carceral state, a term used by scholars to describe the set of organizations and capacities employed by the government to administer its monopoly on violence and maintain order within its borders.<\/p>\n<p>First, mandatory-minimum drug sentences are the keystone of the modern carceral state: they allow for the policing and prosecution of relatively minor crimes and guarantee lengthy sentences for individuals convicted of these offenses, and both factors populate and propel the growth of prisons.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;New York&#8217;s Rockefeller drug laws, passed in 1973, represented a critical juncture in the historical development of the carceral state. They were the first of their kind, and, in the decade following their passage, forty-eight states enacted their own antidrug laws with mandatory-minimum sentences, instigating the rapid rise in the number of individuals imprisoned in state institutions before 1986.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 10-11<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fortner works diligently within these pages to address scholarship along this topic&#8217;s trajectory without becoming a fanboy for any particular set of hypotheses and analysis. He discusses Michelle Alexander&#8217;s &#8220;New Jim Crow&#8221; and without being caustic, he gently explains her shortcomings. He invites us to explore various interpretations of literature within this discourse.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Other accounts connect the rise of the carceral state to the ascendance of neoliberalism. The shift from the industrial society of the &#8220;Fordist-Keynesian order&#8221; to the &#8220;information society&#8221; of neoliberalism displaced American workers, particularly urban African Americans. A confluence of events closed off the labor market to the urban black poor: technological advances decreased the number of labor-intensive jobs, globalization replaced unionized labor in the United States with low-cost workers in other countries, and the information-based service-sector economy required higher educational levels and skills.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 13<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am not a fan of Fortner&#8217;s attempts to &#8220;tell it like it is&#8221;, I am pleased with his ability to frame US Black agency in a way that does not overlook structural accountability. He exemplifies this expertly in this following passage:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be clear, acknowledging black agency in a process does not mean assuming blacks had total control of its outcome. Instead, it means systematically studying the role that black politics played in the formation of crime policies. It also means deconstructing the very notion of &#8220;black interests&#8221; and allowing for the possibility of class conflict. Scholars have been slow to recognize forms fo black class conflict in the post-civil rights period. Michael C. Dawson, for instance, concedes the increasing significance of class in the life chances of African Americans but insists that &#8220;systematic manifestations of these class divisions in the political arena have been difficult to find.&#8221; Dawson offers the theory of &#8220;linked fate&#8221; to explain this paradox, arguing that, because middle-class African Americans and the black poor share a history of racial discrimination, the black middle-class relies on their racial identity rather than class status to understand their individual self-interests. &#8220;Linked fate,&#8221; however, ignores the fact that values operate as interpretative frames that individuals use to understand their material interests and their relationship and obligation to others. Within urban communities across the United States, working- and middle-class African Americans differentiate between &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221;, between &#8220;decent families&#8221; and &#8220;street families.&#8221; And &#8220;decent families&#8221; do not believe that their fate is linked with the fate of &#8220;street families.&#8221; In fact, they are committed to foregoing a future that they trust will be different from and brighter than the one &#8220;street families&#8221; will choose.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 14<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And probably vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sure, this phrase &#8220;street family&#8221; is a bit harsh. This entire dichotomy of &#8220;street family&#8221; versus &#8220;decent family&#8221; does not properly handle those many various mixtures of both. But it does present a well enough starting line. People with criminalized lifestyles have their own sets of values and principles. Often, when a conflict of interest presents itself among members of same race, racial solidarity lacks same cohesion as more immediate identifying factors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> I have to note here, intraracial conflicts in US Black communities, like intraracial conflicts in most other communities, are not simply along class lines. Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, New Orleans, and other various high profile Black areas are not seeped in blood because poor Blacks are shooting at upwardly mobile Blacks. Further, &#8220;upwardly mobile&#8221; might need more elaboration. A person selling drugs is also upwardly mobile, and they do not have to be &#8220;indecent&#8221; about their decorum. Even under definitions that might evolve under &#8220;whyte gaze&#8221;. Class alienation is often more specific in its exclusion, and factors like family, school pedigree, and social interests should be measured.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fortner does offer us his take on why his &#8220;Black middle class&#8221; tends to waiver along moral lines with regards to racial solidarity:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Black Silent Majority<\/i> argues that political aims of black middle-class morality vary according to the nature of threats to their social position. At the turn of the twentieth century, entrenched racism engendered the &#8220;politics of respectability,&#8221; which emphasized &#8220;reform of individual behavior and attitudes both as a goal in itself and as a strategy for reform of the entire structural system of American race relations.&#8221; Fearful of the &#8220;white gaze,&#8221; &#8220;righteous&#8221; middle-class African Americans sought to curtail behaviors among the poor that would perpetuate stereotypes and undercut middle-class claims of equality<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 15<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As stated, I think Fortner definitely paints a vivid image of events. I have my concerns regarding his portrait of class antagonisms as they seem too simplified.

In one of his most notable books, &#8220;Propaganda: The Formation Of Men&#8217;s Attitudes&#8221;, he composes a chapter detailing what he believes are proper conditions for propaganda to grow. In this chapter entitled, &#8220;The Conditions For The Existence Of Propaganda,&#8221; he cites two major pillars for propaganda to thrive and live. Namely, he presents us with one, &#8220;The Sociological Conditions&#8221;, and two, &#8220;Objective Conditions Of Total Propaganda&#8221;. We will deal with that former set of conditions within his framework here.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Within Ellul&#8217;s two pillared organization of those conditions necessary for propaganda, he writes regarding those sociological conditions:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For propaganda to succeed, a society must first have two complementary qualities: it must be both an individualist and mass society. These two qualities are often considered contradictory. It is believed that an individualist society, in which the individual is thought to have a higher value than the group, tends to destroy groups that limit the individual&#8217;s range of action, whereas a mass society negates the individual and reduces him to a cipher&#8230;an individualist society <i>must<\/i> be a mass society, because the first move toward liberation of the individual is to break up the small groups that are an organic fact of the entire society.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>As soon as local organic groupings are reformed, society tends to cease being individualistic, and thereby to lose its mass character as well. What then occurs is the formation of organic groups of <i>elite<\/i> in what remains a mass society, but which rests on the framework of strongly structured and centralized political parties, unions, and so on. These organizations reach only an active minority, and the members of this minority cease to be individualistic by being integrated into such organic associations. From this perspective, individualistic society and mass society are two corollary aspects of the same reality. This corresponds to what we have said about the mass media: to perform a propagandistic function they must capture the individual and the mass at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Propaganda: The Formation Of Men&#8217;s Attitudes&#8221;, Jacques Ellul, pg. 90-91<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What I gathered here from Ellul&#8217;s is probably best articulated by use of a comparison. In identity politics, group identity is forged around what are defined as personal characteristics that are purportedly stigmatized and politicized at a group level. However, each identity as a political organ operates around a set of rules governing inclusion as well as hoisting up representative models as standard bearers. While our society is massive, it localizes not only in proximity but in group communication provided by mass media channels. Who we are is never as important as those groups that we claim to be represented by and affiliated with. In more specific, and possibly costly to me, terms: US Blacks hoist up individual success above group success and as an indicator of potential group success, while actually only being a very loosely associated group of individuals. It is easier to manipulate US Blacks to vote for a member of an elite class if that individual is seen as a representative of that group, not just an individual with personal interests and ambitions.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A group can hold an individual above that group&#8217;s interests if that group sees that individual also as giving that group some sort of representational value. LeBron James, while being only a basketball player, is hoisted as not only one of NBA&#8217;s greatest players but as a representational model of every citizen from Ohio. His success, while purely a consumer driving force in an entertainment market, is not seen in its sole profit motive lens, but in some gross savior\/messiah ontology. This erodes any local criticism of James even at that level of politics, a space James has absolutely no expertise in. His connection to local bodies of people that claim him as a representative is distant and fictive outside of personal nostalgia for one&#8217;s nativity. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ellul continues&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The society that favors the development of propaganda must be a society maintaining itself but at the same time taking on a new structure, that of the mass society&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>A mass society is a society with considerable population density in which local structures and organizations are weak, currents of opinion are strongly felt, men are grouped into large and influential collectives, the individual is part of these collectives, and a certain psychological unity exists. Mass society, moreover, is characterized by a certain uniformity of material life. Despite differences of environment, training, or situation, the men of a mass society have the same preoccupations, the same interest in technical matters, the same mythical beliefs, the same prejudices. The individuals making up the mass in the grip of propaganda may seem quite diversified, but they have enough in common for propaganda to act on them directly.<\/p>\n<p>In contemporary society there actually is a close relation between mass and crowd. Because a mass society exists, crowds can gather frequently &#8212; that is, the individual constantly moves from one crowd to another, from a street crowd to a factory crowd, or a theater crowd, a subway crowd, a crowd gathered at a meeting. Conversely, the very fact of belonging to crowds turns the individual more and more into a mass man and thus modifies his very being. There is no question that man&#8217;s psychic being is modified by his belonging to a mass society; this modification takes place even if no propaganda appeal is made to the soul of the crowd or the spirit of the collective.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Propaganda: The Formation Of Men&#8217;s Attitudes&#8221;, Jacques Ellul, pg 93-94<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This individual produced by a mass society is more readily available, more credulous, more suggestible, more excitable. Under such conditions propaganda can develop best.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Propaganda: The Formation Of Men&#8217;s Attitudes&#8221;, Jacques Ellul, pg. 94<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Before I dig into Ellul&#8217;s extremely pregnant statements there, I need to clarify his sexism. Whether a literary device, a convention of his times, or intentional hierarchy construction based on sexes there, it does cloud what is truly an attention worthy insight. However, I will take liberties here and interpret his singular use of &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;he&#8221; in this above passage as referring to members both sexes, and all those in between. That being written, I agree. Much of our failure to avoid group thought, or hive mind, is because how much our society is saturated in group dynamics even when we seek to absolve our thinking from conformity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Despite how it is worded, I value this insight that suggests there is an altering of our psychology under crowd and group based social objective conditions. Especially when I begin to apply it to my thoughts regarding US Black Media Trust. A framework that questions group obligations to individuals who are hoisted for exact same tendencies that caused that group&#8217;s oppression can only appreciate an examining of group pressure on individual mindsets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French Christian anarchist Jacques Ellul was a noted scholar of propaganda.

His opening chapter,&#8221;<i>Black Beginnings: from<\/i> Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin <i>to<\/i> The Birth of a Nation&#8221;, extends his now ubiquitously familiar framework. In it, he writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The pickaninny was the first of the coon types to make its screen debut&#8230;Thomas Alva Edison proved to be a pioneer in the exploitation and exploration of this type when he presented <i>Ten Pickaninnies<\/i> in 1904, a forerunner of the Hal Roach <i>Our Gang<\/i> series. During his camera experiments in 1893, Edison had photographed some blacks as &#8220;interesting side effects.&#8221; In <i>Ten Pickaninnies<\/i>, the side effects moved to the forefront of the action as a group of nameless Negro children romped and ran about while being referred to as snowballs, cherubs, coons, bad chillun, inky kids, smoky kids, black lambs, cute ebonies, and chubbie ebonies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In all the versions of <i>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin,<\/i> the slave child Topsy was presented as a lively pickaninny, used solely for comic relief.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 7<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The final member of the coon triumvirate is the uncle remus. Harmless and congenial, he is a first cousin to the tom, yet he distinguishes himself by his quaint, naive, and comic philosophizing. During the silent period he was only hinted at. He did not come into full flower until the 1930s and 1940s with films such as <i>The Green Pastures(1936)<\/i> and <i>Song of the South(1946)<\/i>. Remus&#8217;s mirth, like tom&#8217;s contentment and the coon&#8217;s antics, has always been used to indicate the black man&#8217;s satisfaction with the system and his place in it.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 8<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As far as the audiences were concerned, the toms, the coons, the mulattoes, the mammies, and the bucks embodied all the aspects and facets of the black experience itself. The audience&#8217;s deep-set prejudice against any &#8220;foreigners&#8221; accounts for the typing of all minorities in all American films. But no minority was so relentlessly or fiercely typed as the black man. Audiences rejected even subtle modifications of the black caricatures. When Jack Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion of the world in 1908, filmed sequences of him knocking out white Tommy Burns so disturbed the &#8220;racial pride&#8221; of white America that they were banned for fear of race riots. Thereafter, black boxers in films were invariably defeated by their white opponents. Similarly, when the first film versions of <i>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin<\/i> were released in the South, advertisements announced that the black characters were portrayed by white actors. Even at this stage the evolving film industry feared offending its dominant white audiences.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 17<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What I wanted to highlight in these two passages lightly removed from their chapter&#8217;s surrounding context is this notion of mythic types. Ultimately, Bogle is not just saying a particular behavior set performed by US Blacks is being a coon. He is fairly directly saying a particular set of behaviors was utilized by Whyte film makers to present US Blacks to US Whyte audiences in a particular way. Black actors that would eventually begin to be given roles in Whyte produced films would be typecast in these sorts of roles. These roles, these scripted characters, presented through media helped to continue to define patterns of US Black subordination to US Whytes. This is not a nod towards further intonations of US Black respectability politics from US Black bourgeois sectors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do not personally use this term &#8220;coon&#8221; in a loose, affectionate, or joking manner. How I see it being applied by one group of US Blacks to another group is blatant classism and elitism. It is another one of those reasons I have adopted my Black Media Trust framework for critical thinking.There is a line that has to be drawn when dealing with US Blacks as a group obligated to strangers based on outside oppressors in a land they are forced to call their own.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After reading a number of posts from US Blacks on various outlets using this term &#8220;coon&#8221; in a way that made me feel comfortable, I decided to revisit Donald Bogle&#8217;s &#8220;Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, &#038; Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks In American Films&#8221;.

In George Orwell&#8217;s 1984, a department of that main protagonist&#8217;s government is tasked with rewriting history for their media to represent to its people. When I was younger reading this story, I giggled in my naivet\u00e9. These days I simply hope for a continued determination and desire to rummage through tomes of well-documented history so that I might never forget what I a being told did not happen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of those books I have been revisiting is a collection of essays written by Dr. Torrance Stephens, &#8220;Nobel Neocolonialism: U.S. West Asian, North and East African Foreign Policy Under the Obama Administration&#8221;. In an untitled essay(well, at least untitled in his book) contained in his book&#8217;s third chapter, Dr. Torrance writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I heard it mentioned during his state of the union address, how Obama alluded to Tunisia and Egypt in a backhanded way &#8211; saying we support democracy everywhere people for such&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;it is my perception that America does not support democracy and what we see occurring in the Arab world places new definition to the biblical statement of &#8220;a measure of wheat for a penny&#8221; and how this single sentiment in addition to the U.S> position in the region can topple a government.<\/p>\n<p>In fact it could be argued that we, America, created this monster and it may reflect badly about how we go about democracy building around the world. We take the approach of overthrowing an established government and then installing our own and call it nation building. The problem is that true nation building can only occur from the citizenry. We have created a monster, all these years, we have stood by and support tyrants who never supported democratic rule for our own purpose of a so-called peace with Israel or our war on the emotion we call terror.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Nobel Neocolonialism: U.S. West Asian, North and East African Foreign Policy Under the Obama Administration&#8221;, Torrance Stephens, pg 3<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> Dr. Torrance goes on to close this chapter with a discussion regarding &#8220;Islamic radicalism&#8221;. Along that same trajectory as these above-quoted paragraphs, he describes how USA under Obama furthered policies that created internecine conflicts throughout Middle Eastern nations. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What I highlight here mainly addresses several points I have repeated in my discourse I label, &#8220;Black Media Trust&#8221;. Dr. Torrance Stephens aptly describes USA&#8217;s strategy of modern imperialism(neocolonialism), as well as its practices of domestic propaganda. While I do not consider myself responsible for actions of Obama administration or USA military leaders, USA&#8217;s citizenry are often misled through a propaganda campaign that eases tensions with lofty terms that seldom represent objective reality accurately.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Dr. Torrance Stephens accessibly articulates above is how US citizens, through media(mind you, this was written about Obama&#8217;s administration prior to all this hubbub about &#8220;fake news&#8221;) and academia, are persuaded to believe USA is extending &#8220;democracy&#8221; throughout a region whose instability was US manufactured. Whatever voices of those people is to be validated through group choice has to be weighed by factors exported to them by those in USA with enough power to find and exploit natural resources in that area. US government barely cares about maintaining peace and semblance of a democratic choice domestically without corporate gains. It would be a grave oversight in character judgment to think they care more about establishing a system of order outside their control and definition abroad.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As many pundits and political pretenders pander a false notion about US foreign policies prior to present president Donald Trump, I have been running my fingers through better analysis.

There is an aphorism I used to tout fairly regularly that states, <b><i>&#8220;Writing is a conversation, extended throughout time.&#8221;<\/i><\/b>. What I write about is not only another post in a thread, it is a sheet of metal, soldered onto a great ship, giving it further reinforcement to sail these great waters of existence. Which leads my critiques to be open to criticism.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When great minds collide in these sorts of threads, they might forget just how many more others will read their words and join in that conversation. So, it is always incumbent upon persons such as myself burdened with literary aspirations to be mindful of how large an audience based on a conversation extended throughout time can grow.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One example of such collisions of giants reverberating through eras is Richard Wright&#8217;s review of Zora Neale Hurston&#8217;s &#8220;Their Eyes Were Watching God&#8221;. In his article for <i>New Masses<\/i>, he stated:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> It is difficult to evaluate Waters Turpin&#8217;s These Low Grounds and Zora Neale Hurston&#8217;s Their Eyes Were Watching God. This is not because there is an esoteric meaning hidden or implied in either of the two novels; but rather because neither of the two novels has a basic idea or theme that lends itself to significant interpretation. Miss Hurston seems to have no desire whatever to move in the direction of serious fiction. . . .<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>New Masses 5 October 1937, Between Laughter and Tears, Richard Wright, pg 22-23<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It has to be stated here because often we as writers of critique and criticism forget our culpability when addressing our contemporaries. By most accounts, Zora died penniless and in destitution. I can easily argue that without Alice Walker&#8217;s resurrection spell, Zora&#8217;s work might still be in obscurity waiting for another sorceress to give her life again. Her children are grand testimonial to that one bit about pens and swords.Yes, by &#8220;children&#8221;, I mean her tales of Black life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Initial reads of Wright&#8217;s scathing assessment of Zora&#8217;s work left me wondering if it was solely a misogynistic stance. It may have been that case, I also would extend, especially in light of my own reading of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/carol-batkers-hurston-blues-women-class-us-black-womens-clubs-movement\/\" target=\"_black\">Carol Batker&#8217;s explanation of intraracial class antagonism leading to a set of treatments ultimately rendering Zora&#8217;s art invisible<\/a>, that there is a class-based element of scorn and psychological warfare here. Not only is it possible that Wright had no context with which to reasonably assess Zora, he also was disturbed that a woman associated with &#8220;low brow&#8221; renderings wrote it. His reading that her story had no direction, no purpose, and ultimately, no significance was not so much that her writing did not have those things. Only that he wishes his readers to believe they did not.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Just as a heads up, my reasoning is borne of rereadings of this particular paragraph from his review:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n Miss Hurston can write, but her prose is cloaked in that facile sensuality that has dogged Negro expression since the days of Phillis Wheatley. Her dialogue manages to catch the psychological movements of the Negro folk-mind in their pure simplicity, but that&#8217;s as far as it goes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Miss Hurston voluntarily continues in her novel the tradition which was forced upon the Negro in the theatre, that is, the minstrel technique that makes the &#8220;white folks&#8221; laugh. Her characters eat and laugh and cry and work and kill; they swing like a pendulum eternally in that safe and narrow orbit in which America likes to see the Negro live: between laughter and tears.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mind you, this is being penned by that same mind that brought us laughs and cries, killing and raping as trope and excuse, &#8220;Bigger Thomas&#8221;. I have that utmost respect for anyone that can pen novels, but let us be clear. We are discussing that guy that would go on to concoct that quintessential urban Black Male trope. &#8220;Bigger Thomas&#8221; is Donald Trump&#8217;s urban dweller, for christ&#8217;s sake! If Mr. Wright has trouble seeing direction, purpose, and what ultimately amounts to message and moral in Zora&#8217;s &#8220;Janie&#8221;, I have trouble seeing how while crafting his own &#8220;Bigger Thomas&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Being a poorer artist may have saved Zora from that great affliction of successful artists in academia. Namely, that need to appear more serious and be taken more gravely, than actually being something serious and worthy of urgent attention. I do not take for granted how easy it is to be swept away in romantic interpretations of times I did not live through. However, as I cordially add my post to this growing thread, I do hope it is understood that I clearly stand with Zora, and Mr. Wright is blinded by some projection or need to project for audience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One danger of being a writer of criticism and critique of art is that my writing evolves into art itself.

In her work, she uses US Black literature luminary, Zora Neale Hurston as historical embodiment of certain contradictions seldom revealed in discussions of this type. As stated in my reading of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/paula-giddingss-enter-black-womens-club-movement-social-reformism\/\" target=\"_blank\">Paula Giddings&#8217;s &#8220;When And Where I Enter&#8221;<\/a>, there is a leniency shown in class-based critiques of US Black Women&#8217;s Clubs. In  Batker&#8217;s research, she states her major thesis:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is my contention that Hurston has been left out of this debate primarily because her texts disrupts neat dichotomies between respectability and desire, middle- and working-class discourses, and club and blues women. <i>Their Eyes<\/i> alludes to the politics of rape and lynching, as I discuss in detail below, by first charging Janie with sexual misconduct and then by exonerating her, primarily in the trial scene. However, <i>Their Eyes<\/i> does not reject charges of African American women&#8217;s libidinousness at the expense of sexual expression, as literary critics have argued of other texts from this period. Critics like Carby and Deborah McDowell have generally read African American women&#8217;s literature during the Harlem Renaissance as replicating the middle-class conservatism of club discourse and as opposing or suppressing the liberatory sexual discourse of the blues. Hurston&#8217;s text doesn&#8217;t fit this critical bifurcation.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8216;&#8221;Love Me Like I Like to Be&#8221;: The Sexual Politics of Hurston&#8217;s Their Eyes were Watching God, the Classic Blues, and the Black Women&#8217;s Club Movement&#8217;, Carol Batker, African American Review, Vol. 32, No. 2, pg. 200<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Even within this work, there is a need to defend postures of elitism and bourgeois paternalism within what would work as upper middle-class US Black strata. Granted, Batker is not a US Black Woman, and her work is composed years before her most notable publication, &#8220;Reforming Fictions: Native, African, and Jewish American Women&#8217;s Literature and Journalism in the Progressive Era&#8221;. While Paula Giddings takes a much more balanced, yet biased with regard to its lack of critique within a class conscious framework, I feel as though Batker positions herself as a defender of US Black bourgeois value systems with comments such as these in her writing: <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Privileging the working class not only dismisses middle-class African American experience, it also masks the complexity within each group. The politics of both the largely middle-class club movement and the largely working-class classic blues were striated. <\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid, pg 200<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Granted, there is an easiness to acknowledging shared contradictions of framework between oppositional organizations or cultures. However, what this work misses in its attempt at that liberal academic flaw of too much rhetoric, not enough observation, is that those two groups where oppositional based on class. Sure, they shared common contradictions in public speech, writings, performances, and songs. So, Los Angeles&#8217;s Bloods and Crips, it does not make their violent choice of conflict resolution more hopeful. Those contradictions they share, those complexity of both groups, are for most part, non-sequitur. It is their oppositional frames based purely from class structures, adopted as identity and ideology, that create their tensions. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In &#8216;&#8221;Love me like I like to be&#8221;: The Sexual Politics of Hurston&#8217;s Their Eyes Were Watching God, the Classic Blues, and the Black Women&#8217;s Club Movement&#8217;, Professor Carol Batker discusses US Black Women&#8217;s Clubs as they directly relate to US Black Women of lower socio-economic strata.

There is a chapter in this fairly exhaustive text entitled,'&#8221;To Be a Woman, Sublime&#8221;: The Ideas of the National Black Women&#8217;s Club Movement (to 1917)&#8221; that I turned my attention to. While I truly plan on providing my analysis of this entire chapter, and hopefully this entire book, there are a few passages early on in it that I wish to parse in this writing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As I covered in my reading of Lang&#8217;s book, there was always a class-based component of not only US Black Women&#8217;s work, but Women&#8217;s work in large. Here Paula Giddings explains throughout this chapter various battles fought by Black Women&#8217;s Clubs, including their departure from a wider feminism due to Whyte Women embracing racist postures, as well as addressing historic appeals made by Black Women to Black men that sought to employ those same stereotypes of US Black Women as espoused by their Whyte counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In her own words from her extensive research, Paula Giddings writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Black women&#8217;s club movement did have a number of things in common with the White club movement that preceded it. In some ways, as Fannie Barrier Williams noted, Black women were indeed inspired by the success of the White movement. The two groups were organized in much the same way; the General Federation of Women&#8217;s Clubs was the White equivalent to the NACW; the membership of both organizations consisted mostly of middle-class educated women who were steeped in the Protestant ethic. Neither group questioned the superiority of middle-class values or way of life, or had any romantic notions of the inherent nobility of the poor, uneducated masses; education and material progress were values that Black and White women shared.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;When And Where I Enter: The Impact Of Black Women On Race And Sex In America&#8221;, Paula Giddings, pg 94<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the earliest White women&#8217;s clubs was founded in response to the exclusion of women journalists from the New York Press Club in 1868. After helping to organize a dinner honoring Charles Dickens, the women were put out when they were denied tickets to attend the affair. The consequent founding of the Sorosis Women&#8217;s Club set a general pattern for these organizations. They were created by women who were frustrated by their exclusion from occupations and other activities for which their education and background had prepared them. They had little concern for women who were forced to work, with the exception of &#8220;the middle-class spinster, widow, or woman whose marriage had failed, or was doing teaching, doing office work, or in some instances training herself for a profession,&#8221; as a feminist historian noted.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It was not that these groups entirely ignored the plight of the poor. There were salutary efforts toward improving living and working conditions for the less fortunate. However those efforts were often motivated by upper-class frustration. For women, helping the poor was one of the few socially sanctioned activities that could be performed outside the home.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;When And Where I Enter: The Impact Of Black Women On Race And Sex In America&#8221;, Paula Giddings, pg 97<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Continuing along to describe this ideological base of Black Women&#8217;s Clubs, she writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The philosophy of the clubwomen concerning motherhood reflected the new realities they faced in the late nineteenth century. In the 1830&#8217;s, Maria Stewart told Black mothers it was their duty to &#8220;cultivate a pure heart&#8221; and the &#8220;thirst for knowledge&#8221; in their children. By nurturing these noble qualities, Stewart believed, &#8220;the hissing and reproach&#8221; toward the race would cease. More than half a century later, Black women leaders believed that those same qualities were to be taught so that children could <i>endure<\/i> that inevitable reproach. &#8220;We believe,&#8221; said Terrell, &#8220;we can build the foundation of the next generation upon such a rock of morality, intelligence and strength, that the floods of proscription, prejudice and persecution may descend upon it in torrents and yet it will not be moved.&#8221; Josephine Bruce supported that view: &#8220;The Negro home,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is rapidly assuming the position designated for it. It is distinctly becoming the center of social and intellectual life; it is building up strength and righteousness in its sons and daughters, and equipping them for the inevitable battles of life which grow out of the struggle for existence.&#8221; For these Black women the home was not so much a refuge from the outside world as a bulwark to secure one&#8217;s passage through it.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;When And Where I Enter: The Impact Of Black Women On Race And Sex In America&#8221;, Paula Giddings, pg 99-100<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My initial sitting with Paula Giddings&#8217;s work was about five years ago. At that time, I was totally unfamiliar with National Association of Women&#8217;s work. An introduction of their work, their influence on feminism, and more importantly, their strategies of organizing across these United States, culminating into what would be referred to as those &#8220;Black Women&#8217;s Clubs Movement&#8221;. While this history is indeed rewarding, I do feel as though there is a leniency in presenting Black Women&#8217;s Clubs&#8217;s membership motives in comparison to those of their Whyte counterparts.  It would seem to me that based on even just these quotes above, that many of those US Black Women involved with these organizing efforts had extremely bourgeois notions of Negro uplift.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is one of those times where I want to make sure of my intentions with Asylum. These are exceedingly illustrious figures of US Black History we are discussing here. It has to be understood that although I do find it bias for Paula Giddings to frame this membership&#8217;s relations to lower class US Black Women as anything more noble than elitist liberal patronizing and paternalism, these luminaries do have my utmost respect. I just question their ideals and visions of Black progress because they are socialized to define using standards more capable of forming slave masters than slave rebellions or slave escapes. This particular influence on their social politics should not cause alarm or cause a researcher pause; these ladies were social reformers, not revolutionaries or radicals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I wrote last week about Black Women&#8217;s Clubs in St. Louis, I decided to revisit a chapter from Paula Giddings&#8217;s must-read tome, &#8220;When And Where I Enter: The Impact Of Black Women On Race And Sex In America&#8221;.

It&#8217;s much more about taking positions that express the intensity of one&#8217;s commitments than about organizing or building anything. Rather than crafting language to build broad support for a substantively radical program, for instance, ultraleftists prefer potted rhetoric that asserts their bona fides, without concern for communicating outside the ranks of believers.<\/p>\n<p><citing>pg 194<\/citing>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lack of connection to palpable constituencies makes it possible to convince oneself of all manner of ridiculous fantasies.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 195<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;we need a politics that rests on careful, nuanced analysis of the social conditions we live in, grounded on and shaped by a concrete project of advancing the struggle for progressive social transformation.<\/p>\n<p>We need, that is, a politics that proceeds from a subtle form of what used to be called historical materialism.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 195<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, granted, this chapter that I am quoting is in part a not so subtle criticism of anarchist camps and Black nationalists ones, both lanes of thought I support, and that many reading this are proponents of.

This would implore me to qualify him as historian. His book of history details relationships between various class factors in St. Louis, Missouri as it relates to protest, uprisings, and strikes in and around my nativity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Often enough, race in these United States is presented in such a way that it &#8220;flattens&#8221; our social strata. Race is discussed as if class does not exist, or as if class does not influence race like a pack of Kool Aid poured into a pitcher of water influences how we would perceive that water. Class not only &#8220;colors&#8221; race, it redefines our parameters. Lang does a fabulous job unearthing historic social collisions that shaped my hometown&#8217;s socio-political texture.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his first chapter, &#8220;&#8221;, he discusses various local cliques, groups, and organizations whose members helped carve that texture into St. Louis&#8217;s social landscape. One group that he discusses that piqued my interest was what is referred to as those Black Women&#8217;s Clubs. Now, St. Louis was not that only city to have a preponderance of actively organized Black Women, in fact, US Black Women&#8217;s Clubs was a national trend during those times. However, St. Louis did have its own specific history that might helps to understand not only St. Louis&#8217;s brand of US Black Women&#8217;s Clubs, but also those existing nationally.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On that topic, he writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Black clubwomen, many of whom were modestly paid teachers or wage workers, measured their status by &#8220;ladyhood,&#8221; as demonstrated in personal appearance, comportment, and &#8220;moral virtue,&#8221; and conspicuous adherence to patriarchal family norms. Ironically, behind many &#8220;successful&#8221; black businessmen, doctors, or attorneys were the wage-earning wives who actually supported them. Yet, cleaving to prevalent ideals of bourgeois respectability, black women might completely obscure their waged identities, identifying themselves instead by civic associations, the physical maintenance of their households, or some combination thereof. The Elleardsville Social Settlement Club, which sponsored public lectures on hygiene and child-rearing, asserted a place ofr &#8220;the better sort&#8221; of women in domestic management. Homeownership was a trait that particularly distinguished the Ville&#8217;s symbolic elite from the laboring majority who rented housing in the ramshackle Central Corridor. The one- and two-story homes in the Ville were often small brick cottages nestled among unpaved, tree-lined streets. Still, residents took active pride in these single-family dwellings, with the Elleardsville Civic League awarding prizes for the best-kept yard.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Grassroots At The Gateway&#8221;, Clarence Lang, pg 21<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He also discusses another group of US Black Women from St. Louis whose class designations and political associations might bar them from membership in those same US Black Women&#8217;s Club. He writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The emphasis on industrial strongmen in Communist iconography not only implicitly devalued black women&#8217;s particular issues around work and living conditions, but it also ignored their involvement in the presumabl masculine arena of street battles&#8211;as in the case of the black women whose charge at the doors of City Hall had ignited the July skirmish. It also ignored their pivotal role in the imagined male preserve of union organizing. Drawn to the council&#8217;s neighborhood-level mobilizations, where they came into contact with radical labor organizers, black women became especially active in renewed unionization drives. Indeed, the most significant black Communist-oriented labor insurgency in St. Louis was &#8220;manned&#8221; not by thick muscled, square-jawed heroes idealized in proletarian art and literature, but rather by black women employed in the marginal sweatshops of the city&#8217;s food-processing industry.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Grassroots At The Gateway&#8221;, Clarence Lang, pg 29<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Lang continues further in his book to describe how these US Black Women laboring in R.

And where it does not, it may be reasonable to question whatever conservative strands of thought have caused changing dynamics to retard.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Anna Julia Cooper&#8217;s A Voice From The South, there is a patriotic sentiment that reminds me of my own times. In her first chapter, &#8220;Womanhood A Vital Element In The Regeneration And Progress Of A Race&#8221;, she discusses treatment of Women by various patriarchies. She speaks of what she refers to in this writing as &#8220;Oriental countries&#8221;(in her words this includes those of China and Islamic nations such as Turkey) as well as Europe and United States of America. She does not mention in these earlier pages any nations of Africa. Her thoughts of Europe and America(USA) are affectionate, they seem to find more in common with propaganda than intellectual rigor. Of course, academic USA has always had its profit motivations sacrificing its more noble potential for propaganda or even more grossly, marketing. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Let me sprinkle some quotes so that I am not mistaken for putting words in her writing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Cooper states:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Happiness,&#8221; says Madame de Stael, &#8220;consists not in perfections attained, but in a sense of progress, the result of our own endeavor under conspiring circumstances <i>toward<\/i> a goal which continually advances and broadens and deepens till it is swallowed up in the Infinite.&#8221; Such conditions in embryo are all that we claim for the land of the West. We have not yet reached our ideal in American civilization. The pessimists even declare that we are not marching in that direction. But there can be no doubt that here in America is the arena in which the next triumph of civilization is to be won; and here too we find promise abundant and possibilities infinite.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;A Voice From The South&#8221;, Anna Julia Cooper, pg. 12<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Paranthetically, I really need you to understand that context which this was delivered and received. This was composed in 1886. We are discussing a scholar who only knows 31 years of US existence without US Black forced southern subordination prior to those national hostilities of 1910s and 1920s. Her only understanding of US as an embryo is while US Blacks are slaves and discriminated against in every position in lieu of wealth and pedigree.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>She continues this line of thought with:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Respect for woman, the much lauded chivalry of the Middle Ages, meant what I fear it still means to some men in our own day&#8211;respect for the elect few among whom they expect to consort.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The idea of the radical amelioration of womankind, reverence for woman as woman regardless of rank, wealth, or culture, was to come from that rich and bounteous fountain from which flow all our liberal and universal ideas&#8211;the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 14<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Cooper&#8217;s is a dangerous analysis that attempts to frame one set of oppressions as better than another without considering whatever benefits each influence on that other. Islam nor Christianity lives historically in a vacuum unfiltered by that other set of beliefs. Islam is not limited to that Arabian Peninsula any more than Christianity was limited to Constantine&#8217;s reign. As &#8220;Mahomet&#8221; is inspired by stories visited upon of Jesus to speak into Quran an entire surah(chapter) devoted to Mary(not to mention another entire surah translated,&#8221;The Women&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do, however, want to applaud her feminism. While limited to a late 1800s Black Church interpretation of Christianity, there is a criticism I want to be associated with Black Media Trust. She does question purpose of male praise of Women at a cultural(systematic) level where it reinforces systemic oppressions of Women. This is something she does often throughout this piece that I simply adore her for.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, my concern with her religiosity here is its lack of research and appreciation for other religions solely because they are not Whyte European religions. This writing is read by Ms. Cooper in front of a &#8220;convocation of colored clergy of the Protestant Episcopal Church at Washington, D.C.&#8221; according to a footnote. David Walker&#8217;s Appeal is also written as from a heavily religious centered perspective. I am reminded of when Dr. John Henrik Clarke in &#8220;Who Betrayed The African World Revolution?&#8221; discusses not being able to discuss socialism in anti-religious terms with Black Church goers. If I am being harsh here, it is not because of Ms. Cooper&#8217;s religious tone, it is because her tone is dripping with Whyte Supremacist notions hidden by a group think centered processing of religion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This chapter, once again, is addressing Washington D.C. clergy at that end of 19th Century USA. You as a well-researched reader should automatically think Talented Tenth level patronizing negroes and pandering to Whytes. No disrespect to this grand Woman, but she definitely does not disappoint in either of those departments. However, for those of us who live by a critical thinking based on Black Media Trust, she does leave even us a few redeemable gems like that one I discussed above. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of such snippets from this writing I am quoting here:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stranger and more significant than all, the leading men of this race (I do not mean demagogues and politicians, but men of intellect, heart, and race devotion, men to whom the elevation of their people means more than personal ambition and sordid gain&#8211;and the men of that stamp have not all died yet)<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 35<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Tasty, right?
