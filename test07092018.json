Especially US media that has been highly touted as representing US Blacks. In fact, I enjoy a predominantly Whyte productions more. This could be a factor of 1930s popular psychology frameworks like &#8220;self-hate&#8221;. I personally sum it up as being tired of watching other Blacks worship representation that never amounts to more than symbols. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his &#8220;Die Nigger Die&#8221;, H. Rap Brown discusses &#8220;self-hate&#8221; from a perspective that is more praxis and less manipulative rhetoric. He makes a statement that US Blacks are &#8220;exposed to this country&#8217;s strongest institutions every day.&#8221; This exposure is not just programming from educational systems as H. Rap Brown addresses, but also from USA&#8217;s deeply entrenched media system.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That media entrenchment is not limited to presentations of Whyte USA, but also employs US Blacks and Afrikans of various nations to spread its messaging. This media system does not have to invent new forms of culture, as Jared Ball suggests in his work, &#8220;I Mix What I Like: A Mixtape Manifesto&#8221;, it only has to usurp and invade less empowered cultures.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In chapter&#8217;s one first section entitled,&#8217;The Colonized Rhythm Nation,&#8217; Jared Ball sets out to frame Hip Hop culture as a language and collection of artifacts worthy of designating its practitioners as a nation. He is not framing all US Blacks as citizens of this &#8220;nation&#8221;. Much of his usage of this framing is not to lift Hip Hop itself to a status, per se. His embrace of this framing of nationhood beyond territorial identifiers(land) is more to show Corporate America&#8217;s imperialist\/colonialist prowess.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is demonstrated in his own words when he writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The United States is often referred to as an \u201cempire,\u201d just as an ever expanding community engaged in various aspects of its elements is often referred to as a \u201chip-hop nation.\u201d But too rarely are the two concepts appropriately related. That is, if this nation is indeed an empire, it then proceeds from and is itself engaged in imperialism, or \u201cthe practice, the theory, and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory.\u201d Empire is also a \u201crelationship, formal or informal, in which one state controls the effective political sovereignty of another political society,\u201d and this can be arrived at \u201cby force, by political collaboration, by economic, social, or cultural dependence. Imperialism is simply the process or policy of establishing or maintaining an empire.\u201d And as an empire, its relationship to its own citizens and certainly other nations is one of colonialism. Empires create colonies, externally and internally as well. Within the U.S., whether Indigenous, Black, or Latino or the more popular, politically safer, and less racially-specific \u201chip-hop nation,\u201d all exist more as internal colonies as opposed to free and equal citizens. And therefore, interpreting them as such, while challenging to conventional wisdom, is far more appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;I Mix What I Like: A Hip Hop Manifesto&#8221;, Jared Ball, chapter one<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Father of Two, and Communications Scholar(*smiles*), Jared Ball presents a set of answers that also raised a few questions for me. I am one of those late seventies babies that embraced music as a lifestyle. Living in St.Louis, Missouri in 1980s meant you got your hip hop as an imported product. I heard Dana Dane over a dubbed cassette made by downstairs neighbor in our complex hallway when he came back from visiting his family on summer vacation. I sat outside Streetside Records while my older friends purchased cassettes with stickers that prevented me from purchasing directly. When me and a cadre of close childhood comrades came late to an EPMD signing at Vintage Vinyl in U City&#8217;s Loop, I ran up to their van and got an autographed poster anyway. Even in our adulthood, going out to concerts showcasing artists from Doug E. Fresh to Rick Rozzay casted lifelong friendship into memory. If there is a Hip Hop Nation, I am one of its indigenous natives.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That particular distinction does come with a set of defenses related to my dislike of much US Black media. Whenever a scathing critique of Black Twitter makes its viral rounds, those of us most associated with that labeling begin to question who is Black Twitter. In that same vein, I often question exactly who makes up this Hip Hop Nation that Jared Ball points to. Ever since I was younger, like pre-teens younger, there has been a going separation of hip hop fans and hip hop artists. That framework rests on a label of either &#8220;hip hop&#8221; or &#8220;rap.&#8221; A silly distinction that almost never explicates that most of Hip Hop post-1970s is commercially driven.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This defensive posture is probably mostly a result of Hip Hop&#8217;s enjoyment factor. Many will argue that Hip Hop stands as a vehicle for social messaging. This I do not disagree with, however, Hip Hop is party music. Hip Hop is a good time. Like much organic or grassroot artistic expression, it weaves a socially pleasurable technique with an awareness of social climate and texture. It is not Hip Hop&#8217;s fault that sex is as pleasurable an act to engage in as it is one to discuss over an 808 bass heavy beat. It is not Hip Hop&#8217;s fault that violence attracts our attention like a train wreck. Whatever commerical factors Hip Hop succumbs to, those elements most pointed out to distance one artistic expression from another have always existed in Hip Hop&#8217;s more nascent moments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is not Hip Hop&#8217;s commercial appeal, however, that makes it a target for usurpation. It is Hip Hop as a cultural artifict of a group of people that cannot defend it from outside Corporate interests that makes it an interesting resource. Jared Ball describes this dynamic when he states:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Empires do not deal with equally sovereign nations or citizens. Empires reduce nations (those both exterior and interior to themselves) to satellite client-states, which do not contain equally free sovereign people but at best \u201ccitizen-subjects\u201d who, even when born into a \u201cfirst world\u201d setting, are met by the \u201cintersections of race, culture, sex, gender, class, and social powers [that] are already locating in order to provide a particular space to hold [them].\u201d This allows for appearances of \u201cfreedom\u201d where \u201cgood citizens\u201d unconsciously \u201creplicate the social order and its hierarchizations, usually without the necessary imposition of directly brutal state force.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;I Mix What I Like: A Hip Hop Manifesto&#8221;, Jared Ball, chapter one<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Jared Ball cleverly, if not brilliantly, maps for us here is that relationship between extremely powerful entities and their only so powerful global neighbors. I do agree with some academics that Black Nationalist embrace of internal colony framing presents a few cavaets. What Jared Ball is doing, however, is presenting concrete and historically objective relationships beyond their abstract labelings. As he argues in this chapter, there are no land based distinctions for Empires, only rulers and resources. Whatever we call Hip Hop purists and fans, it is essential to understand that our cultural artifacts have been used because they are valuable. As an analysis, there are not many working frameworks outside of studies of settler and indigenous native that map well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jared Ball continues along this similar trajectory of thought:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&#8230;]regardless of whether we embark upon an analysis of rap music, or the entire \u201chip-hop nation,\u201d as being \u201clocated within a continuum of black cultural movements including the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s\u201d or \u201cthrough an evolution of African American musical production, with the blues, jazz, and R&#038;B as its predecessors\u201d or \u201cmapped diasporically as a point of convergence for African polyrhythms, Brazilian capoeira, and Jamaican sound systems,\u201d what cannot be avoided in any case is that it emerged as part of a pre-existing, and global, imperial process of colonization that had long been in full swing.69 The hip-hop nation is a colonized extension of a predating and continuing colonialism that engulfs its progenitors and governs still the process and necessity of the theft of soul or the grossest forms of distortion of communication.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;I Mix What I Like: A Hip Hop Manifesto&#8221;, Jared Ball, chapter one<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/black-media-trust\/douglas-rushkoffs-life-inc-history-exploitative-capitalism\/\" target=\"_blank\">In &#8220;Life, Inc&#8221;, Douglas Rushkoff<\/a> places capitalism along a historical trajectory with Royal commercial charters. These charters were crafted, not for growth of &#8220;free markets&#8221;, but so that powerful families could control how domestic markets were controlled, and how foreign resources where exploited. In many ways, Jared Ball envelopes elements of Black USA under a term that can explain developments similar to what Rushkoff attempts to point at. It is less about Hip Hop, more about domestic or indigenous resources being exploited and exported for gains garnered by elite powers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"John Carlos &#038; Tommie Smith: Black Power Salute At Olympic Victory Rostrum[Full Video]","content":"<p>John Carlos &#038; Tommie Smith joined history&#8217;s most iconic protests after staging their Black Power Salute at 1968&#8217;s Olympic Victory Rostrum.

Of her, our mysterious chronicler types:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shirley Schmitt is no one\u2019s idea of a dangerous criminal. She lived quietly on a farm in Iowa, raising horses and a daughter, until her husband died in 2006. Depressed and suffering from chronic pain, she started using methamphetamine. Unable to afford her habit, she and a group of friends started to make the drug, for their own personal use. She was arrested in 2012, underwent drug treatment, and has been sober ever since. She has never sold drugs for profit, but federal mandatory minimum rules, along with previous convictions for drug possession and livestock neglect, forced the judge to sentence her to ten years in prison. Each year she serves will cost taxpayers roughly $30,000\u2014enough to pay the fees for three struggling students at the University of Iowa.

It comes with certain assumption and prejudice, sure, but it belongs in a space of networks. We are given undue advantages based on superficial characteristics shared by members of a more powerful group. However, when privilege is being extended, I also make it my duty to put my notebooks to good use.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I find it difficult not to read certain racial codes into this piece. While I do believe in prison reform in some measure, I also believe prison reform in modern liberal space is US Whyte for &#8220;we are locking up too many of our own.&#8221; Albeit, I refuse to cut my nose to spite my face, there are a number of liberal measures that US Blacks can glean diminutive gains from. This does not, however, reduce what I believe is an intent to reduce class antagonisms within US Whyte ranks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That all be stated, I do find framing prison as a financial burden <i>interesting<\/i>, for lack of a better qualifier there. I have stated elsewhere, I am sure, that I find moral reasoning to be a bore. At some point, US Citizens must come full circle with their acceptance of what USA exactly is despite its wholly hypocritical yet lofty philosophical State&#8217;s Craft. In order to deal with a prison system that was always a double for slavery and free labor, an argument for tax payer&#8217;s being fleeced yet again must be spun to Whyte readers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>America passed the point of negative returns long ago. Its incarceration rate rose fivefold between 1970 and 2008. Relative to its population, it now locks up seven times as many people as France, 11 times as many as the Netherlands and 15 times as many as Japan. It imprisons people for things that should not be crimes (drug possession, prostitution, unintentionally violating incomprehensible regulations) and imposes breathtakingly harsh penalties for minor offences[sic]. Under \u201cthree strikes\u201d rules, petty thieves have been jailed for life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A ten-year sentence costs ten times as much as a one-year sentence, but is nowhere near ten times as effective a deterrent. Criminals do not think ten years into the future. If they did, they would take up some other line of work. One study found that each extra year in prison raises the risk of reoffending by six percentage points. Also, because mass incarceration breaks up families and renders many ex-convicts unemployable, it has raised the American poverty rate by an estimated 20%. Many states, including Mr. Sessions\u2019s home, Alabama, have decided that enough is enough. Between 2010 and 2015 America\u2019s incarceration rate fell by 8%. Far from leading to a surge in crime, this was accompanied by a 15% drop.<\/p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/leaders\/21722642-lot-known-about-how-reform-prisoners-far-too-little-done-americas-prisons-are\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Jail Break: America\u2019s prisons are failing.

The ways capitalism works and does not work determine the role the Internet might play in society. The profit motive, commercialism, public relations, marketing and advertising&#8211;all defining features of contemporary corporate capitalism&#8211;are foundational to any assessment of how the Internet has developed and is likely to develop. Any attempt to make sense of democracy divorced from its relationship to capitalism is dubious. Despite all of the routine assumptions equating capitalism&#8211;or its euphemism, free markets&#8211;with democracy, they remain distinct undertakings with very strong tensions that can boil over into direct conflict.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning The Internet Against Democracy&#8221;, Robert McChesney, pg 13<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He furthers his point and his criticism of capitalism further in his book when he puts this forth:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is only recently, as capitalism has floundered, that it has become almost mandatory to regard capitalism as permanent, irreplaceable, and benevolent. As recently as the 1960s and 1970s, when it produced golden-age results in America by today&#8217;s standards, it was more common to have frank, no-holds-barred discussions of the system&#8217;s merits and demerits. Gong back further, many of the great economists,<br \/>\n including John Stuart Mill and John Maynard Keynes, understood capitalism as a historically specific system, not as the eternal state of nature for humanity.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning The Internet Against Democracy&#8221;, Robert McChesney,pg 229<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Robert McChesney furthers his argument:<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;The capitalist system was able to thrive, on and off, during the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries,&#8221; Jerry Mander wrote in 2012. &#8220;But it&#8217;s now obsolete, nonmalleable, and increasing destructive.&#8221; Capitalism &#8220;had its day. If we care about the future well-being of humans and nature, it&#8217;s time to move on.&#8221; This is &#8220;radical&#8221; talk, but Mander, a former successful advertising executive, makes it clear that he is no socialist or Marxist. We are, in his view, at the point where we are dealing with an economy structured &#8216;to sustain the institutions and the people who sit at the top of the process.&#8221; The &#8220;system is bound to fail.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p>Capitalism has become what Mander terms &#8220;a kind of &#8216;third rail&#8217; of politics&#8211;forbidden to touch.&#8221; He acknowledges, &#8220;It remains okay to critique certain aspects of the system,&#8221; but the capitalist system itself &#8220;occupies a virtually permanent existence, like a religion, a gift of God, infallible.&#8221; The reason is obvious: those in power do not wish the system that makes them powerful to be questioned. Keeping capitalism off-limits to critical review is essential for that system, because it generates demoralization, disengagement, and apathy. This is not a political economy that can withstand much engaged political participation. To question the performance and suitability of really existing capitalism at a time when the world is falling to pieces does not necessarily make one an anticapitalist in some universal sense. It means one recognizes that a system that promotes poverty, inequality, waste, and destruction&#8211;to the point of making the planet uninhabitable&#8211;deserves no free pass from democratic interrogation in the present, whatever its past achievements.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning The Internet Against Democracy&#8221;, Robert McChesney, pg 228<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Nearing his book&#8217;s conclusion, he succinctly poses:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;digital technologies may bring to a head, once and for all, the discrepancy between what a society could produce and what it actually does produce under capitalism. The Internet is the ultimate public good and is ideally suited for broad social development&#8230;Under really existing capitalism, however, few of the prospective benefits may be developed&#8211;not to mention spread widely.

At root, this is a story of a business that fails in its unstated but aspirational profit objectives.

That statement evokes and reinforces that wall around capitalism, that myth of Protestants of justly poor,<br \/>\n those Divinely sanctioned for life as slaves, peasants, paupers, prisoners, and homeless. It shows that his initial objective is less about helping others, more about raising someone to their proper position through this magic of code and business savvy. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While I do believe that Leo&#8217;s story removes much stigma surrounding homeless persons, I think it also fails to realize reasons why those stigmas, and homelessness, exists in these United States of America. No one high on any drug wishes for that intoxication to end. Most addiction is a form of chasing initial highs or greater ones. Power is a human high. It feels good to control others, to manipulate social conditions for one&#8217;s aims, to be acknowledged for such forays. All society is agreement. Capitalism(I really appreciate how McChesney words it,&#8221;really existing capitalism&#8221;) is a social contract that suggests some will be allowed to apotheosized above others for creating dams to resources we all contributed to amassing a surplus of in some means.

Comparing Dave Chappelle to Richard Pryor, he essentially hypothesizes that Dave Chappelle and Richard Pryor both transition from more &#8220;urban Black&#8221; forms of humor in front of Whyte audiences as a means of respecting that culture.  In that essay, I highlight Cobbs&#8217;s pertinent sentiment concerning Richard Pryor and Dave Chappelle&#8217;s respective &#8220;conversions&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pryor told the <b>New York Times Magazine<\/b> in 1975, &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a thin line between being a Tom and [depicting] human beings. When I do the people, I have to do it true. If I can&#8217;t do it, I&#8217;ll stop right in the middle rather than pervert it and turn it into Tomism. There&#8217;s a thin line between to laugh <b>with<\/b> and to laugh <b>at<\/b>.&#8221; That line was at the forefront of Pryor&#8217;s mind when he returned from Africa in 1979. He renounced his use of the word &#8220;nigger,&#8221; later saying in his autobiography that it was &#8220;a wretched word. Its connotations weren&#8217;t funny even when people laughed&#8230;It was misunderstood by people. They didn&#8217;t get what I was talking about. Neither did I.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p>Despite his later concerns, Pryor could get away with a skit like &#8220;Bicentennial Nigger,&#8221; in which a slave laughs about two centuries of bondage, rape, and lynching, because his 1976 audience understood the bitter indictment he was actually articulating. It would&#8217;ve been disastrous for the crossover Pryor of the 1980s to undertake that kind of sophisticated irony. The last skit Chappelle did before leaving the show was one in which a minidevil perches on people&#8217;s shoulders encouraging them to behave in stereotypical ways. In his case, the devil&#8211;who appears in blackface&#8211;convinces Chappelle&#8217;s character that he&#8217;ll be fulfilling a stereotype by ordering chicken on a flight. He dodges that trap by ordering fish, but the minstrel rejoices when learns it is catfish. The moral of the story is clear: Chappelle&#8217;s character lives in a catch-22 where anything he does fulfills some trait on an infinite checklist of stereotypes. It is a riff on the racial gymnastics required to negotiate the most routing of daily scenarios. Or it is a hilarious bit about a jigaboo dancing on an airplane. Depending upon who you&#8217;re talking to.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;The Devil &#038; Dave Chappelle, &#038; Other Essays&#8221;, William Jelani Cobb,<br \/>\n pg. 250-251<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In May of 2017, Dave Chappelle performed at a charity gala for New York City&#8217;s Robin Hood. Robin Hood is an organization that bills itself as &#8220;Targeting Poverty In New York City&#8221;. While its website did not help me much in understanding their mission statement, they do claim that they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.robinhood.org\/what-we-do\/metrics\">&#8220;wrote the book on smart giving&#8221;<\/a>. However, for our purposes here, Dave Chappelle&#8217;s comedic monologue is sufficient despite his audience&#8217;s somewhat mysterious identity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am including what appears to be a bulk of that routine&#8217;s video here.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><video width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" controls><source src=\"https:\/\/owlasylum.net\/[DaveChappelle]5_15_17__Robin_Hood_Benefit_2017.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\"><\/video><br \/>\n<cite>Dave Chappelle Performing At Robin Hood Charity Gala May 2017<\/cite><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dave Chappelle works in a world of narrative, satire, and stereotype. I consider one of Dave Chappelle&#8217;s comedic strengths his ability to include everyone in on a joke. Cobbs considers Richard and Dave&#8217;s work to be &#8220;inside jokes&#8221;, laughter aimed at others in an exclusive vernacular. I think differently. Dave Chappelle uses our othered counterparts as a mirror into our own ridiculous habits.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Take for example this routine&#8217;s introductory narration. Once again, mystery aside, but context matters. That is to say, his audience is a group of rich New York liberals that organize to end poverty in New York City. Dave Chappelle&#8217;s verbal skit, his narrative, is about a rich Black guy complaining about racism while living in luxury and spending exorbitantly while dodging a random homeless person. His story&#8217;s &#8220;moral&#8221; is a day of dealing with racism while enjoying shopping in upscale spaces and buying his homeless character a green velour Sean John outfit from Macy&#8217;s. He is not making fun of that homeless person; he is making fun of his audience via his own personage as narrator. &#8220;Making fun of&#8221; might be misinterpreted; I believe that metaphor of &#8220;holding a mirror up&#8221; to be a bit too self-righteous for Dave Chappelle&#8217;s brand, but it may work better to explain my thinking here.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do not think Richard or Dave Chappelle need to be so tied to stories with morals. This can be shown somewhat by Dave&#8217;s own parenthetical to his audience about his story going &#8220;nowhere&#8221;. However, as Cobbs notes, I do believe both funny men exist in a &#8220;damn if you do, damn if you do not&#8221; paradox. In that paradox, they both work using humor in self-deprecating ways. Pryor&#8217;s is much more direct, highlighting his own infamous literal self-destruction with recreational substances. Chappelle mentioning that his homeless counterpart is also a Vietnam veteran borrows heavily from that same tradition of public self-ridicule as personal growth that Richard was so instrumental in defining.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Dave Chappelle&#8217;s earlier work, he presented his viewing audience a series of skits entitled, &#8220;When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong.&#8221; These sketches had as premise a notion regarding consequences that might ensue when we attempt to abide by certain principles. Jelani Cobb interpreted this skit as:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The series &#8220;When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong&#8221; ridiculed the street ethics that have metastasized throughout black culture.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;The Devil &#038; Dave Chappelle, &#038; Other Essays&#8221;, William Jelani Cobb,<br \/>\n pg. 251<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I think those sketches were more of a reflection of that comedic genius that wrote and performed them. Dave Chappelle is being self-deprecating,<br \/>\n and he invites us to share his personal inside joke. That joke being inside only in that we are also its butt. Dave Chappelle keeps it so real, that often it is difficult to be correct about where we think he has gone wrong.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Todd Steven Burroughs&#8217;s Officious Objectivity And That Case Of Manning Marable&#8217;s Fib","content":"\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/uncategorized\/at-the-kwanzaa-expost-louis-2011\/\" target=\"_blank\">Around five years ago, I had that immense pleasure of sitting in on a lecture given by late and great Black Arts Movement parent, Amiri Baraka<\/a>. Amiri spoke to a number of topics, including but not limited to St. Louis&#8217;s penchant for producing insanity. Among that &#8220;not limited to&#8221; were his thoughts regarding Manning Marable&#8217;s book,&#8221;Malcolm X: A Life Of Reinvention&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>His was a take that would be shared by a number of other active critiques of Marable&#8217;s text. Included along with Mr. Amiri&#8217;s own writing, <a href=\"https:\/\/imixwhatilike.org\/aboutimwil\/#jaredball\" target=\"_blank\">associate professor Jared Ball<\/a> and lecturer Todd Steven Burroughs compiled an assembly of critiques from renown active thinkers. As a conclusion and wrap up of this anthology titled,&#8221;A Lie Of Reinvention: Correcting Manning Marable&#8217;s Malcolm X,&#8221; Todd Steven Burroughs invites us to sit with him during a panel discussion as well a slightly fictional one in Malcolm&#8217;s Harlem. Before this, however, he takes us to roots as a journalist&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One day when I was lost, I discovered a Black writer by the name of Manning Marable.

When we read <b><em>Pravda<\/em><\/b> and <b><em>Izvestia<\/em><\/b>, no one doubts that the perspectives of Soviet writers advance a particular view on society and politics. And when one reads the <b><em>New York Times<\/em><\/b>, everything from the selection of stories to the orientation of the editorials represents a type of bias towards the white corporate establishment&#8230;\u201d <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Todd Steven Burroughs&#8217;s fast forwards through time to after Manning&#8217;s death, a full stop making &#8220;Reinvention&#8221; grave marker and calendar highlight. Burroughs details a panel discussion composed of poetry luminary Sonia Sanchez, Manning&#8217;s lead researcher, Zaheer Ali, Peniel E. Joseph, and Herb Boyd. It is here that Burroughs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/marimba-ani-yurugu-logic-disharmony\/\" target=\"_blank\">reminds me of a sentiment expressed by Marimba Ani regarding western objectivity<\/a> as it is presented in journalism and academia. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Strangely, that moment at the Harlem Book Fair felt like incidents I had read about in some of the media theory and criticism books I\u2019ve read and tried to understand. In those books, left-of-center media scholars write about how \u201cobjectivity\u201d limits the intellectual range of information given to the public. They argue that those who own and control the media only want an \u201cacceptable\u201d range of criticism aired and printed, with \u201cacceptable\u201d being defined by the owners and controllers themselves.[&#8230;] Were the Harlem Book Fair organizers and these panelists essential \u201coperators\u201d of a pre-determined, live, public, televised presentation of ideas? Were they doing to me, an openly harsh critic of Marable\u2019s <b><em>Malcolm X<\/em><\/b>, what African American political and cultural activists claim Whites in power have done historically, and still do, to them?<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Coda: Objectivity vs. Memory&#8221;, Todd Steven Burroughs, found in &#8220;A Lie Of Reinvention: Correcting Manning Marable&#8217;s Malcolm X&#8221;, chapter 20<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here Burroughs highlights our journalistic and academic weaponizing of &#8220;objectivity.&#8221; It is that same still method of creating an epistemological hierarchy that belittles&#8211;or demonizes&#8211; methods of truth presentation outside of modern hegemony. In this instance, it codifies any critic of contemporary academia as &#8220;backwards,&#8221; &#8220;uncivilized,&#8221; &#8220;unworthy&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Later, Burroughs borrows bits of each critique writer throughout his and Jared Ball&#8217;s assembly, forming his own response panel of sorts. All of these synopses deserve your immediate attention and diligent perusal, but I would like to visit what Burroughs writes of his Amiri.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Amiri Baraka:<\/b><\/span> Some of the characterizations in the book are simply incorrect and suffer from its author only knowing about the movement on paper.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Coda: Objectivity vs. Memory&#8221;, Todd Steven Burroughs, found in &#8220;A Lie Of Reinvention: Correcting Manning Marable&#8217;s Malcolm X&#8221;, chapter 20<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As meta of a writer as I may become(I am writing a review\/critique of a review\/critique of review\/critique), I must accept that there must be a standard set for who can say what.

Anything shy of that bar is simply pushing an agenda, resting very close to cowardice as one is talking behind a man murdered for his people as well as his beliefs in front of his family and city&#8217;s back with no care for apparent caution, and an abuse of authority.  Not above critique, just also worthy of a treatment of respect that is not beneath anyone&#8217;s humanity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Weaponizing objectivity without concern is antithetical to objective reality, which is supposedly that function western thinkers hold to as ideal.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Steve Biko Discusses How Words Create Hierarchy And Dehumanization","content":"<p>Billed as &#8220;Biko&#8217;s Last Public Statement And Political Testament&#8221;, Steve Biko&#8217;s <i>Black Consciousness In South Africa<\/i> is a transcription of Steve Biko&#8217;s May 2, 1976 testimony during a trial for nine BCM activist accused of subversion in South Africa.

Objectivity can create social conditions whereby groups of people deemed as less objective&#8211;or more emotional&#8211; are rendered unfit for authority, such as women in male-dominated societies.

One of those prongs is &#8220;Sociological Conditions&#8221;.<\/a> Of those conditions he writes,<i>&#8220;For propaganda to succeed, a society must first have two complementary qualities: it must be both an individualist and mass society. These two qualities are often considered contradictory. It is believed that an individualist society, in which the individual is thought to have a higher value than the group, tends to destroy groups that limit the individual\u2019s range of action, whereas a mass society negates the individual and reduces him to a cipher\u2026an individualist society must be a mass society because the first move toward liberation of the individual is to break up the small groups that are an organic fact of the entire society.&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Ellul&#8217;s framework, there is a need for an exclusive &#8220;better&#8221;(his &#8220;individuals&#8221;), and a mass of amorphous objects to be categorized and controlled(his &#8220;mass society&#8221;). Some might wonder why this is so. I believe Author of &#8220;Yurugu: An Afrikan-Centered Critique Of European Cultural Thought And Behavior&#8221;, Marimba Ani can offer some insight here. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>She writes in <i>Yurugu<\/i>:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any discussion of the nature and origin of European epistemology must focus on, if not begin, with Plato. This is not to say that he was not influenced by the pre-Socratic African philosophies that proceeded him. But what Plato seems to have done is to have laid a rigorously constructed foundation for the repudiation of the symbolic sense&#8211;the denial of cosmic, intuitive knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>[&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p>The dialogue the <i>Republic<\/i> is Plato&#8217;s ideological justification of the State he wishes to bring into being. What we witness in the dialogue can be viewed epistemologically as the creation of the object&#8230;.The acquisition of knowledge involving immersion in this universe until, through sympathetic participation, meaning is revealed, expressed, and understood via complex and multidimensional symbols. But in the &#8220;new&#8221; epistemology we exchange symbols for &#8220;objects.&#8221; The creation of the object requires a transformation of the universe, no longer experienced but rather, &#8220;objectified.&#8221; This transformation is achieved through a changed relationship of the knower to the known&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>        <cite>&#8220;Yurugu: An Afrikan-Centered Critique Of European Cultural Thought And Behavior&#8221;, Marimba Ani, pg. 30<\/cite>\n      <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Her initial assertion, along with historical qualification, works to establish an ideological center and fulcrum. While there are probably a number of other philosophers she could mention, her use of Plato does more for resonance, and Plato&#8217;s <i>Republic<\/i>(and <i>Cave<\/i> allegory) are templates of federated state rule, validations for social class organization and subsequent resource allocation, and existentialism as self versus self and every other entity from nature to family. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&#8230;]<br \/>\n        Two things occur, one effecting the other. First, the psyche undergoes a transformation: Slowly the &#8220;self&#8221; is perceived differently from before; then, the universe to which that self relates is perceived differently, because the nature of the relationship is changed. The self is no longer a cosmic being, instead it becomes &#8220;the thinking subject.&#8221; The Greek word <i>psyche<\/i> indicates an understanding of an autonomous self distinct from everything surrounding that self. The primary function of this self becomes the &#8220;knowing&#8221; and &#8220;thinking&#8221; of scientific activity, which is no longer connected to &#8220;intuiting.&#8221;&#8230;This new self becomes fiercely isolated from its environment. Why autonomous, distinct, and isolated? Because this &#8220;thinking being,&#8221; if it is to be capable of scientific cognition, must be, most of all, <i>independent<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>        <cite>&#8220;Yurugu: An Afrikan-Centered Critique Of European Cultural Thought And Behavior&#8221;, Marimba Ani, pg. 30-31<\/cite>\n      <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&#8230;]The success and appeal of Homer&#8217;s epic depended on the identification of the audience with the characters and plot.

Education is used as a weapon against us. News media is used as a weapon against us. Athletics. We dominate in athletics, but we don&#8217;t control them. Therefore the negro athlete is used as a weapon against us. This country realizes that the athlete has an image in our community. So they get some ol&#8217; bootlicking, shuffling, money-mad negro, who can run or jump, and they tell him, &#8220;Go control your people. If we can&#8217;t control athletes, we can sure cripple &#8217;em.'&#8221; Brothers ought to break him up so bad, until he&#8217;ll to die to get well. The same thing goes for entertainers.

I do wish he had spent more time with that discussion. He does offer his solution to a problem that apparently extends even into my era. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another thing that is used effectively against Blacks is the court system. There is no justice in this country for Black people. Justice is a joke, and it stinks of hypocrisy. Lyndon Johnson is Hitler&#8217;s illegitimate child and J. Edgar Hoover is his half-sister. Justice means &#8220;just-us-white-folks.&#8221; there is no redress of grievance for Blacks in this country.

The Vietnamese and Latin Americans&#8211;america says that she&#8217;s in their countries to stop communist aggression. America has never moved to stop communist aggression in white countries by utilizing anti-personnel bombs and napalm; in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, she uses RADIO FREE EUROPE; never weapons of destruction. It is important to note here that all the countries with people of color are the ones militarily attacked by america. So why should we be immune to her racism? We experience it every day. We were brought here to do work, there is no more work. Machines do the jobs we used to do. The Attorney General made a statement a few weeks ago; it was interesting in this respect; he said, &#8220;Within 20 years the entire population of this country will be a leisure class, with the exception of ten percent of that population, because of automation and cybernation.&#8221; Then when we look to see who they are training for those jobs, we find that they are training whites.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg 139<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have not made any progress since we have been in this country.

Upon close examination, I find the thrust of most militancy is toward reform, not revolution. A militant in this case is one who never stops talking. Militants will bust their balls, campaigning to get some cracker elected. Black militants grow naturals to appear on t.v. as cops shooting blacks for this country. There is not one negro on t.v. that has a politically meaningful role: <i>I Spy<\/i> is the logical extension of <i>The Lone Ranger<\/i>; my man is just Tonto.

But america does not respect negroes; negroes don&#8217;t respect themselves.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 121<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Using &#8220;america&#8221; as a metonoymy for US Whyte Supremacy, he underlines its proven objective of maintaining a racially coded system of class. Noting as well, this devotion of US Blacks to find their place within it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each individual Black person decides for himself whether or not he hates all whites. Racism in reverse is charged when Blacks don&#8217;t profess their undying love for whites.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 121<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap states a simple formula. For US Blacks, racial antagonistic attitudes are at an individual level. US Blacks do not have a collective or organized power structure to impose any systemic measures that makes their feelings anything more than an isolated occurrence. Blacks are held to a standard of racial tolerance that is not only hypocritical and illogical but also extreme.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Black Movement has never pushed the doctrine of racial superiority. But what upsets the media is that we don&#8217;t say we love all white people. White folks get up tight if the first words of a Black person say don&#8217;t deal with love. That&#8217;s their problem. If they haven&#8217;t been oppressing Black people then they ain&#8217;t got nothing to feel bad about.  <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 124<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown furthers this line of rationale by reminding history that US Blacks within his movement have not promoted a propaganda of scientific racism. His is not a campaign to reduce Whytes to animals like Thomas Jefferson did to Blacks, or to place them on an evolutionary trajectory that likens them to neanderthals like Charles Darwin did to Blacks. However, in his not creating more confusion based on racial competition and domination, he also does not see where it is necessary to &#8220;love&#8221; all Whyte people or any, for that matter. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>White people got hung up on integration. Segregation was the problem and the elimination of segregation was the solution, not integration. It was the unequal nature of segregation that Black people protested against in the South, not segregation itself. Separate but equal is cool with me. What&#8217;s the big kick about going to school with white folks? Them that want to do that should have the chance. But that ain&#8217;t no solution.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 124<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>He extends this notion with a quote from Franz Fanon:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fanon says of racism, &#8220;It stares one in the face for it so happens that it belongs in a characteristic whole: that of the shameless exploitation of one group of men by another which has reached a higher stage of technical development. That is why military and economic oppression generally precedes, makes possible, and legitimatizes racism. The habit of considering racism as a mental quirk, as a psychological flaw, must be abandoned.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 125<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown explicates his ideas regarding power structures and systems. Note his stance on Black leadership after power structures are usurped, while systems are left intact.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now there&#8217;re a lot of people who say that the way you change laws is to destroy the power structure. I say you got to go beyond that. If you destroy the power structure, it can always be replaced by another power structure, whether it&#8217;s white or Black. The power structure serves the system and the system is the thing which demands exploitation of people. You have to destroy the system. You can destroy the power structure and leave that system intact. But if you get the system, you got the power structure. That&#8217;s the job which confronts us.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 125<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once again, H. Rap Brown displays his political maturity. He reminds us that &#8220;liberation movements&#8221; must be directed by needs and pain points of those people a movement is supposedly directed to liberate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Liberation movements must be based upon political principles that give meaning and substance to the struggle of the masses of people, and it is this struggle that advances the creation of a people&#8217;s ideology. Liberation movements from the very beginning must be dedicated to the principles that speak to the needs of the poor and oppressed, or must evolve into this type of movement with these principles while the fighting is going on, for it is not evident that those who fight will assume power and implement decisions that appropriate the wealth of countries for all people. <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 128<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must draw from all ideologies those principles which benefit the majority of mankind. We cannot limit ourselves to just one concept or ideology that was relevant in some other revolution. As Debray point out, and correctly so, in his book <i>Revolution Within the Revolution:<\/i> &#8220;Revolutions cannot be imported nor exported.&#8221; Certain changes have made even some of the most advanced ideologies obsolete.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 128<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I broke this into two salient ideas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> Firstly, throughout this book his political breadth has widened. While I still feel his specific agenda is a US Black one, he embraces an all-encompassing revolutionary practice. He states &#8220;principles which will benefit the majority of mankind&#8221;. This infers a vision of revolution that is not limited to US Blacks in these United States. In fact, it also infers certain compromise in order to find those principles, that Summum bonum.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That second bit of thought I wanted to tease out here was his ability to disperse with particulars when they are no longer applicable. His is not a romantic or religious association with group political change. He also is not handcuffed to any set of solutions simply because they are from US Blacks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many people have had these principles (principles that speak to the needs of the mass of humanity) in mind as they were waging a struggle for independence, but having failed to win independence by defeating the enemy through armed struggle, it was necessary for them to negotiate with the colonial powers. In this process of negotiation, the colonial powers granted political autonomy but maintained economic influence, control, and investments. The mere act of negotiating freedom means that the control necessary to appropriate the entire wealth of the country did not fall to the new leaders. We should have learned by now from history that the process of negotiating freedom and not winning it by armed struggle has built-in limitations. We must be prepared to fight to the death to destroy this system known as capitalism, for it is this system that oppresses the majority of mankind.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 129<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As I pointed out above, H. Rap Brown has a singular focus that is not limited to one group of people. However, I do believe H. Rap Brown has a practical appreciation for local engagement. His central target is a system of oppression he frames as capitalism. Whichever methods necessary to attack and dismantle that system are determined by local variations and exploits determined by those people expressing pain due to that system of capitalism.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&#8230;]What is known as politics in this country is meaningless. People have been told that politics means the Democratic and Republican parties; federal, state, and local government; the vote. History shows that politics as it is defined by america is undesirable and dangerous to Black people, for the politics of capitalism has always been human oppression and exploitation. We must begin to relate to the politics of revolution. Chairman Mao says, &#8220;Politics is war without bloodshed and war is an extension of politics.&#8221; Every action that we are involved in is political, whether it is religious, artistic, cultural, athletic, governmental, educational, economic or personal. There is no seperation between church and state, art and politics, or politics and individual beliefs. Everything is inherently political. The only division occurs around the question of whose political interest one will serve.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 130<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown&#8217;s politics is abstracted in a similar manner as his revolutionary spiritualism. Sure, it is extremely pragmatic and rooted in empirical processes. It abhors absolutes, yet it embraces abstraction at that level of collective peoples. It is a politics that operates at local levels, while considers a global solution. With this sort of foundation, it is easy to understand how annoy H. Rap Brown must be in a nation where politics is reduced to media circus.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown scoffs at popular pronouncements and understandings of politics here in United States. This paragraph is not only him explaining his vision, but him laughing at those who define politics in this puerile bi-partisan manner.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Without a common Black political doctrine, america will use (and is using) Blacks against Blacks. Blackness must be political in our behalf. Individuals can no longer be immune to public political criticism because they are &#8220;Black and proud.&#8221; There must be revolutionary political criticism of counter-revolutionary positions and acts. Some individuals who gain popularity in Black america are later used as tools by white america. In most cases, white political interest comes as a result of the existing popularity of the Black individuals. Understand, popularity does not reflect correctness. Blackness alone is not revolutionary.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 130<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I agree with H. Rap Brown&#8217;s assessment that without a common, articulated, verbally agreed upon(as opposed to tacitly assumed) set of visions and outcomes, there will always be room for manipulation of US Blacks at a mass level. I totally disagree with any belief that this could ever happen, though.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Again H. Rap Brown explicates his disdain for fictive obligations in political space. Just because a person is &#8220;Black and proud&#8221; does not give them carte blanche from criticism. Their behaviors should still be examined; their motives and interests even more so. In H. Rap Brown&#8217;s revolutionary politics, racial fictive kinship is not a precursor for loyalty or accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we examine Cleveland, Ohio, Gary, Indiana, Washington, D.C., and many other areas populated predominately by Blacks we can see a tactic being used that has often been tried in Africa, Vietnam, and other oppressed countries. It is called neo-colonialism. In other words, when white structures and institutions are threatened whites protect their economic and political interests and maintain control by using members of the oppressed people as their spokesmen. They set up puppet governments headed by individuals with white interests in mind. These people oppress their own kind for their personal gain. These puppet leaders are as dangerous as those whom they represent.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 130<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is important that H. Rap Brown compares US Black celebrities being used to direct US Blacks for US Whyte interests to neo-colonialism. For years now, I have attempted to find a better term that speaks specifically to what occurs in Black USAmerica. That this particular tactic has not ceased in its malignant effectiveness from when H. Rap Brown wrote this to my era is very telling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>White folks realize now that they can concede Blackness and still exercise control. This country says, &#8220;Yes, you may be Black; but, you must be american,&#8221; which means we are as responsible for oppression as whites. This country says, &#8220;Yeah, you may have Black heroes; but, we must approve of them.&#8221; So, they publicize negroes who have been beneficial to this country.<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg. 130<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here we see H. Rap Brown upbraiding US Blacks attached to this neoliberal machinery. H. Rap Brown determines that any Black allowed to represent Blacks at that nation media level must also be reflecting values of a capitalist state.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must say as Fidel Castro says, &#8220;No liberalism whatsoever! No softening whatsoever! A revolutionary people, a political people&#8211;a strong people&#8211;this is what is needed throughout these years&#8230;.What do the dangers or the sacrifices of a man or of a nation matter when the destiny of humanity is at stake?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>      <cite>pg 131<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"H.

Rap Brown, pg. 103-104<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      I think it is important to address H. Rap Brown&#8217;s distress here. I am not sure how this book was written, but it definitely unfolds like a diary or journal. In its initial chapters, H. Rap Brown frames US Blacks in a very binary manner. As his experiences and thus praxis expands and is more informed, this worldview also alters. No longer is his stance on &#8220;Negroes&#8221; that sole fuel of his ire. We now see a more politically sophisticated and specific pain point being pronounced. There are members directly involved in &#8220;movement&#8221; space who despite whatever motives, are detrimental to that movement. While H. Rap Brown states in so many words that these persons talk too much, it is not his main concern. I think his more salient point here is that these persons do not have as central agenda those decisions and vision of those people they are representing.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        Half of the Black &#8220;militants&#8221; ain&#8217;t nothing but a bunch of potheads, bootleg preachers and coffeehouse intellectuals. They are caught up in that whole identity thing. They just discovered that they were Black, because they were working so hard all their lives to be white. They&#8217;re further away from being revolutionaries than the poor people who are not militantly political. But the coffeehouse intellectual, the Black militant, thinks he&#8217;s political because he reads Fanon. Books don&#8217;t make revolutionaries.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 104<\/cite>\n    <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      It must be noted, H. Rap Brown writes this based on his direct involvement with personalities associated with 1960s activism and protest. His framework for critical assessment of movement types is now taking shape. Not only is every Black person not immediately a political ally, political allies with platforms must also be scrutinized heavily.\n    <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        [&#8230;]I contend that the Black people who burned down Watts and Detroit don&#8217;t have to read. These cats have lived more than the intellectual has read. So they are political by having learned from their existence. Oppression made these cats political. The militants spend all their time trying to program white people into giving them some money. &#8220;The man&#8221; has created a new type of Tom. They are wiling to be anything, as long as they can be Black first. Black capitalists, Black imperialists, Black oppressors&#8211;anything, so long as it&#8217;s Black first.\n      <\/p>\n<p>      <cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H.

Rap Brown furthers this here by defining &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; and &#8220;politically active&#8221; by one&#8217;s experiences, not simply what books one can quote. Throughout this chapter, his main theme centers revolutionary action as a process of people being self-determining, not leaders, or authorities dictating personal visions. I do not personally hold this same definition of &#8220;revolutionary&#8221;, but my definition does share his where it expresses a need of concrete direct action and engagement with state authorities(or those authorized by that state).\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      This last point addressed by H. Rap Brown is also pertinent. He includes in his definition of &#8220;negro&#8221;, thus &#8220;assimilists&#8221;, those involved in activism and protest spaces that are driven my identity politics. In his revolutionary ontology, those Blacks that are driven by a need to have Black representation and &#8220;Black firsts&#8221;, are also opportunists and assimilists.\n    <\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"H.

Nonviolence might have been tactically correct at one time in order to get some sympathy for the Movement, but for me as an individual, it just never worked.

As US Blacks (especially Black males) are furthered molded in media as &#8220;savages&#8221;, whether literal animals or just criminally uncivilized, US Blacks in protest space seemed to fear any form of resistance that involves physical retaliation to physical onslaughts.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      H.

Even people in SNCC. The first time I got busted in Alabama, it was on a concealed weapon charge, and people in the Atlanta SNCC office wanted to know why I had a gun. This was in 1966 when SNCC was talking Black Power. They debated over whether or not to get me out of jail and they didn&#8217;t. Ed put up my bond. That was some shaky muthafucking shit. But I made it very clear to them. Yeah, I would give up my .38 when they gave me a laser gun. If <i>you&#8217;re<\/i> gonna woof at the muthafucka, then I&#8217;m gon&#8217; carry some shit to back up the woof. They could put me out of the organization, but they weren&#8217;t taking my gun.

His stance on violence is deeply entrenched in personal survival, but it is also just as richly influenced by not only a local group sense of identity, or racial, but also a global identification with all oppressed peoples. This identification is not symbolic, but includes embracing concomitant corporeal sacrifice. He sees fear of death as an excuse to behave cowardly when faced with personal physical confrontation.\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      &nbsp;\n    <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        [&#8230;]A lot of people say that it&#8217;s regrettable that Malcolm got killed. But Malcolm was not an individual. His life didn&#8217;t belong to him. No revolutionary can claim his life for himself. The life of the revolutionary belongs to the struggle. Malcolm, like Che, is not dead, because he was totally committed to the struggle. The only people who should make any kind of statement of regret over Malcolm&#8217;s death are Malcolm&#8217;s family. Death is the price of revolution. Malcolm assumed that responsibility and he knew what role he was playing.

Rap Brown, pg 75<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once again, I sense that thread of definition that weaves throughout this book. He touches on a topic that <a href=\"https:\/\/imixwhatilike.org\/2017\/04\/28\/the-myth-of-black-buying-power\/\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Jared Ball has written and curated research on<\/a>. Namely, this myth that one can purchase national liberation of an entire population of more than thirty million at time of H. Rap Brown&#8217;s writing. While I sense our limited options, I do believe it is foolhardy to phrase Black Banking, Black group economics, or Black financial security as a revolutionary tool or even radical. It is a survival mechanic, at best, and just another opportunist scheme marketed as &#8220;messianic measure&#8221; at its worst. H. Rap addresses it blatantly as a &#8220;hustle&#8221;, a con. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap describes Gaston Neals&#8217;s New School of Afro-American Thought organizing an arts festival in Washington, DC. According to H. Rap Brown, there was a Whyte right wing group, Voice of America, that apparently also received funding from same institutional authorities. Voice of America wished to video record Gaston Neal&#8217;s community program. H. Rap response:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let the muthafucking crackers tape nothing. They just wanted to use it as propaganda in Africa, to try and show how happy we all are with all this freedom and democracy they got here in this country, and we know that&#8217;s a crock of shit.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 76<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In our own times, I doubt most video footage of socio-political activity is utilized for such measure, but I definitely agree to overall sentiment here. Whether it is Instagram images, Twitter hashtagged images or protest b-roll, and even full blown theater distributed documentaries, there is probably always an ulterior motive for displaying public grievances against a state. H. Rap Brown deals with a much more pronounced propaganda. My present era, USA 2017, decades after repression, is a lot heavier with neoliberal, &#8220;go get the money&#8221; style socio-politics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his concluding pages of this chapter, H. Rap Brown relates his dealing with local police in this nation&#8217;s capital, District of Columbia. In his words, he was asked by police to join on a number of occasions. He was relentless in refusal. He addresses how working in those Black communities of Chocolate City(back when it still applied), gave him leverage to demand certain concessions even with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I went over there one other time to talk with this Captain about the police messing with some people. I told him that the community was about to explode if he didn&#8217;t do certain things. I told him that we&#8217;d unleash the people on his ass. So they started doing things like integrating patrol cars. It really showed me how much the structured feared our community and that the strength really lies in that community. The cops ain&#8217;t worth shit if a million muthafuckas decide to kick their ass&#8230;But we must understand that the cops are not the only problem. Cops serve the system, just like the army in Vietnam. The system allows cops to be what they are.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 78<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Maybe Misanthrope Is Real Cool, Too ::: My Highlights Of Gwendolyn Brook&#8217;s &#8220;Annie Allen&#8221;","content":"<p>Gwendolyn Brooks published &#8216;Annie Allen&#8217;, an epic style book of prose about a Black Woman coming of age in Chicago, in 1949.

Rap Brown directs his attention to young Black University students in chapter six of &#8220;Die Nigger Die&#8221;. Bookended by depictions of his experiences  working with SNCC in Atlanta and on Washington DC&#8217;s Howard University campus lies his synopsis:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Negro college students have always felt themselves to be better than the brother on the block.<br \/>\n Naturally, the brother would resent this and the first chance he got, he was upside the college student&#8217;s head. That situation can only be overcome by the college student taking the initiative in overcoming whatever split might exist between himself and the blood on the corner.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg 66<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown stays consistent with his framing of US Blacks as a dichotomy of anti-establishment &#8220;Blacks&#8221; versus assimilating &#8220;negroes&#8221;. In these sentences, H. Rap Brown is re-establishing a class relationship. He is reversing those roles, and responsibilities, normally associated with those on corners in context with those in colleges. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do have my disagreements with this approach. I do not think revolutionaries are bound by any moral, racial, social, or whatever-al motivations. For me, revolution is a purely political act defined and limited only by whether an actor successfully took control over a nation-state&#8217;s governing apparatus. I also do not promote a romantic perspective of poverty. I know people that will rob their own nephews for a five dollar shard of cooked cocaine. Structural mechanisms may make it difficult to avoid certain circumstances, agreed. But it also means my security is entrenched in being able to treat each individual as an individual, and respecting my right to choose who I obligate myself to regardless of race or class.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>College students, however, get caught in a trick, because they think that to be accepted by the young bloods, they have to be tough, be a warrior. But all they have to do is show that brother that they respect him and that they recognize that he is a brother. All Black people are involved in the same struggle. Revolutionaries are not necessarily born poor or in the ghetto. You don&#8217;t have to throw a Molotov cocktail to be a revolutionary. There is a role for every person in revolution if he is revolutionary.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg 66-67<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am once again conflicted by H. Rap&#8217;s words here. In one instance, it seems to be a healthy discussion of why Black essentialism should be shunned. Every Black person is not from a hood, and therefore does not have to carry themselves as one. Cool. However, there is also this counter thread extending through his overall framework that results in a false equivalence. Specifically, all Blacks that attend college are sheltered suburbanites that cannot defend themselves(Also that all Blacks from a hood can fight, but that&#8217;s probably more straw than even I am willing to pull at). I think it is necessary to qualify that more than just &#8220;Black college students&#8221; that are &#8220;revolutionary&#8221;. But, I do think it is healthy to establish a manifesto, if not mandate, for what Black education <i>could<\/i> do in spaces where brain drain from hoods is not a motivation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing which the Black college student can do is to begin to legitimatize the brother&#8217;s actions&#8211;begin to articulate his position, because the college student has the skills that the blood doesn&#8217;t have. It reminds me of the old story about the father and his son. The son comes to the father and says,&#8221;You told me that the lion was the king of the jungle. Yet in every story I read, the man always beats the lion. Why is that?&#8221; The father looks at the son and says, &#8220;Son, the story will always end the same until the lion learns how to write.&#8221; If you don&#8217;t begin to tell your own story, you will always be Aunt Jemima; you will always be &#8220;rioting.&#8221; You must begin to articulate a position of your own.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 67<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap Brown presents yet another interesting intersection here. Yes, again, I write this while he is still asking college students to play a fictive and obligatory role. Yet, in his framing of that request, he is also suggesting a position of authority, and identity. As I have stated throughout my highlights of this book, there is a theme of definition that courses loudly, yet logically. Here, it is no different.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yes, OWL is hyper allergic to obligatory social schematics of kinship. But, I read this as one might an entente. H. Rap Brown addresses class antagonism&#8211; in which he not only writes with bias but writes with a prideful bias&#8211; by demoting <i>and<\/i> elevating those Black University students. Sure, this compromise is still hierarchical, obligatory, and romantic. I may come back to this at another date.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Aside from a lack of needed qualifications, I do agree with H. Rap Brown&#8217;s premise. He capitulates later in this chapter with:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The education that a Black college student gets will be irrelevant, fruitless, and worthless unless he uses it to define and articulate positions that are relevant to Black people.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H.

Within this framing, he also extends his theme of definition that we have found throughout this entire book.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biggest difference between being known as a Black man or a negro is that if you&#8217;re Black, then you do everything you can to fight white folks.<br \/>\n If you&#8217;re negro, you do everything you can to appease them. If you&#8217;re Black, you&#8217;re constantly in and out of trouble, because you&#8217;re always messing with &#8220;the man&#8221;. If white folks say it&#8217;s more cultured to whisper,<br \/>\n you talk loud. If white folks say gray suits are fashionable, you go buy a pink one.

Whatever the enemy opposes, we support.&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t read Chairman Mao when I was in high school, but I already understood that fundamental revolutionary principle.<br \/>\n I knew white folks couldn&#8217;t do wrong right, so whatever they thought was good, I knew wasn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 55 <\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I believe reading this out of context could provide a dangerous and simplistic justification for anti-intellectualism in US Black communities. I speak English. Regardless of whatever idiolect, dialeact, or sociolect my St. Louis upbringing wraps that language in, my mastery of this bastard tongue influences my social network. H. Rap here is not being that literal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> However, it can be difficult to delineate where behaviors stemming from a need to appease Whytes starts and ends in this social spectrum of USAmerican acculturation. What H. Rap Brown leaves us here with is a guide, similar to what I present in US Black Media Trust, that seeks to at least question why we might define one style as &#8220;high culture&#8221; as opposed to another style. He also offers us clear explanation for why some US Blacks adopt styles that are often presented as counter-culture or rebellious.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is from this crux that H. Rap Brown primes us for his anecdotal analysis of integration.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Integration was never our concern. In fact, integration is impractical. You cannot legislate an attitude and integration is based upon an attitude of mutual acceptance and respect between two racial or cultural groups in the society. A law can govern behavior, but attitudes cannot be forced or enforced, and what the Civil Rights Movement was concerned with was controlling the animalistic <i>behavior<\/i> of white people.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg 55-56<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I highlight this not only because it is crucial to this chapter, but also because it is data crucial to contextualizing what many of us simply romanticize. Without me linking to anyone&#8217;s poll, I do believe there are enough of us that share similar beliefs about integration&#8217;s limits, and psychological suggestions of Black inferiority. From an economic stance, integration has only worked to devalue US Black dollars even more than they already were. For someone deeply entrenched in organizing that involved tactics associated with integration to state that &#8220;integration is impractical&#8221; is refreshing and strategically rewarding.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In this chapter&#8217;s concluding paragraph, H. Rap discusses, and I have highlighted, United States Of America&#8217;s 36th President, Lyndon Baines Johnson specifically, and Democratic Party in general.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The anti-war movement now recognizes what Black people have learned. Johnson was elected in 1964 because he said that Asian boys (you dig him calling grown men &#8220;boys&#8221;?) should fight an Asian war. And Johnson got the biggest popular vote in american history and proceeded to fight the war like he was defending ol&#8217; ugly Ladybird from an attack. He did not recognize the popular vote. He recognized the Democratic Party. And it should be clear to all by now that there is no difference between the Democratic and Republican parties. There&#8217;s only one party in america and that&#8217;s the party of white nationalism. Both parties have made it clear that they will not tolerate dissent, it wouldn&#8217;t mean a damn thing, because dissent does not change policy. A hundred thousand people went to the Pentagon, and Johnson escalated the war. People took over the streets of Chicago and the Democratic Party nominated Hump the Dump. When the people cannot find a redress of their grievances within a system, they have no choice but to destroy the system which is responsible in the first palce for their grievances. The government is the lawbreaker. The people must become the law enforcer. We cannot allow the government to be an outlaw, particularly when the crime is against the people.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Die Nigger Die!&#8221;, H. Rap Brown, pg. 62-63<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once again, it is important that someone who worked with those people that brought US Blacks to Democratic Party speak on illusive nature of USA&#8217;s two party politics. It is also necessary to that H. Rap Brown frames this analysis along with a set of fairly transparent examples of Democratic Party hypocrisies and opportunisms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Also highlighted here, is a reflection I have looked over in my past readings of this text. He states, and I quote again:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Both parties have made it clear that they will not tolerate dissent from Blacks or from whites. And even if they did tolerate dissent, it wouldn&#8217;t mean a damn thing, because dissent does not change policy. A hundred thousand people went to the Pentagon, and Johnson escalated the war. People took over the streets of Chicago and the Democratic Party nominated Hump the Dump.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It has to be noted again that these words were first published in 1969. Over a course of a little less than 48 years, they still are characteristic of modern Democratic Party policy towards its constituents. In 2008, US Blacks suffered from predatory lending that still impacts predominantly Black areas like metro Atlanta and Prince George&#8217;s County. In 2009, after historic support from this same bloc of voters, within Y&#8217;all&#8217;s Daddy Obama&#8217;s first 100 days(why is that so damn coveted anyway?) he signed a bill that would give those that harmed that same bloc of voters billions of dollars. A bill, mind you, that was originally crafted and unsuccessfully pushed by Republican President George W. Bush&#8217;s administration.

People should adhere to rules because they respect them and not because some position mandates that respect. Now if you raise a legitimate issue with a person and they respect it, then they&#8217;re gonna adhere to it. It&#8217;s like the principle of self-determination.

Rap Brown discusses through analysis and anecdote his thoughts regarding US Black collective self-defense. His notions of violence and defense not only include physical combat, but also envelope his ideas of wage labor and systemic psychological abuse.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He begins this chapter narrating an incident as a boy scout in Louisiana. According to him, he was shot with bb guns and ripped his uniform trousers while escaping. He was subsequently harrassed by a Whyte patroller during all of this. He decided he would take his chances at LSU where his Boy Scout Troop was meeting, torn pants and all. I quote his words:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I began to recognize then the value of being violent. I knew I hadn&#8217;t done anything to make them white muthafuckas shoot their B.B. guns at me, so I knew that the world didn&#8217;t run on love. The only thing that was gon&#8217; keep white muthafuckas off you was you!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The best example of that in the world today is america. America has made it clear that she respects only violence&#8230;America does not love China, but she refuses to move against China because she has the bomb. And all those troops. So what that means is that Black people have to address themselves to defending their communities and their homes, because if you can&#8217;t defend them, you can&#8217;t control them.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 37<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Without this seeming like some nod to &#8220;toxic&#8221; masculinity, I did find that last line compelling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;if you can&#8217;t defend them, you can&#8217;t control them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So often in socio-political literature, analysts and theorists find it difficult to link self-defense and self-determination. It tends to be easier for many in this space to associate &#8220;getting money&#8221; with political independence, but here, H. Rap is connecting one&#8217;s ability to ward off threat with one&#8217;s ability to govern and plan for future activity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He continues his thoughts regarding violence with:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Violence is accepted in america as long as it&#8217;s white folks doing it. Turn on the t.v. and you go deaf from all the gunfire. Let two fighters get in the ring and let neither one of them hit the other and see what the real savages out there are going to do. They&#8217;re going to scream for blood.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 38<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here, H. Rap connects power of definition with violence. I immediately thought of Whyte protesters violently attacking other Whyte protesters during <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/04\/15\/524122918\/protesters-use-april-15-to-demand-trumps-tax-returns\" target=\"_blank\">Trump Tax Release rallies<\/a> being as acceptable as Whyte hockey players mauling each other during games. When US Blacks are simply preparing for a protest, there is an immediate outcry for peace and a curtailing of violence even if it is violence against US Blacks being protested!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap resumes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So the question is not can Black people be violent. They send us to Vietnam and brag about what good fighters we are. It&#8217;s legitimate for a Black man to go over there and kill 30 Vietcong and get a medal, but you come back here and kill one racist, red-necked, honky, camel-breathed peckerwood who&#8217;s been misusing you and your people all your life and that&#8217;s murder. That&#8217;s homicide, because the white man has the power to define and legitimatize his actions. He can legitimatize violence. At this point we must adddress ourselves to defensive measures, something that will counteract that violence.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 38<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here H. Rap adds clarity. In Western society, social Darwinism and Machiavellianism are a fairly ubiquitous ontology. Robert Greene&#8217;s success with &#8220;48 Laws Of Power&#8221; is illustrative here. There is something to be said about one&#8217;s power to legitimatize violence and their ability to then legitimatize their humanity. As Fanon might write, there is a humanizing aspect to violence when one is able to define it as humane.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap invites a bit of Fanon in his thinking when he discusses violence as a unifying force. He states:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One significant thing about Detroit and Newark was that the violence created a peoplehood.<br \/>\n Black people had walked around under the illusion that they had a class system in the Black community. But the white man changed all that. He went in and beat &#8220;middle-class&#8221; as hard as lower-class Blacks. And &#8220;middle-class&#8221; Blacks were throwing as many fire bombs as the brother on the block. And afterwards, there was a real sense of community among the people, a real feeling of pride and togetherness&#8230;So a peoplehood was forced upon Black people, through white violence.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 39<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I think that last sentence should be altered some.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;So a peoplehood was forced upon Black people, through white violence,&#8221; should be changed to a peoplehood was consecrated among a group of Black people from various backgrounds because they chose to fight that Whyte violence back. That &#8220;peoplehood&#8221;, that fictive kinship, did not come solely through white violence, but at that price of active engagement against that hostile presence. There is a major difference there that I believe needs to be accentuated.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a segue from his discussion of direct conflict into a paragraph or more about intraracial classism, he begins to expound on institutional racism as a form of violence. Within this discussion, he points out how US Black Media is directed towards a neoliberalism as Black editors and decision makers seek to stall approval of Black direct actions unless a green light is given from a Whyte party. He writes<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of white america is a structure of institutions that says to Black people, &#8220;Nigger,<br \/>\n you ain&#8217;t shit.&#8221; All standards of excellence, beauty, efficiency and civilization are such that any comparison between Black and white is designed to favor white and put down Black.<br \/>\n And it&#8217;s ground into a Black person every minute of every day, whether you&#8217;re at work or whether you&#8217;re out trying to have some fun, it&#8217;s Nigger you ain&#8217;t shit.

Rap Brown spends time addressing US Education as an institution of division and hierarchy establishment. He begins this argument by addressing individualism and territoriality in US Black spaces. H. Rap communicates:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Given the destruction by slavery of both tribe and culture, negroes create a new kind of american tribalism. A tribalism based on the exclusion of certain types. A deliberate attempt to make race a secondary consideration. There are tribes and tribes of negroes. The A.K.A. tribe, Kappa tribe, Doctor tribe, Teacher tribe, Entertainer tribe, High School tribe, College tribe, etc. This tribalism has extended into what is called the &#8220;Movement.&#8221; &#8220;Militant&#8221; tribes compete against other &#8220;militant&#8221; tribes and &#8220;moderate&#8221; tribes, to promote tribal interests and not the interests of the race or the masses. We treat revolution as if it is an historic process rather an evolutionary movement. In other words, we all got a monopoly on truth. Whites who consider themselves allies add to this by deciding which tribe is &#8220;correct&#8221; and which is &#8220;incorrect.&#8221; In other words, the one which best fits their needs.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 16<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>White folks get all righteous and wonder why Black people steal and gamble. Same reason white folks do. We need money, because the society says you must have it to keep from starving. If you got it, you eat. If you don&#8217;t, tough. But white people are able to make their stealing and gambling legitimate. White man&#8217;ll sell you a $20 suit for $50 and call it good business. What he actually did was steal $30. White man&#8217;ll buy a watch for $5.00 sell it for $49.95 and call the difference, profit. Profit is a nice word for stealing which the society has legitimatized.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 18<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In this chapter, H. Rap introduces a character from his past by way of anecdote. J.S., throughout this chapter, comes to symbolize those academically capable but underprivileged US Blacks that schools leave behind. In his own words, H. Rap explicates:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The teachers had to tell J.S. he was smart, &#8217;cause it was so obvious. But they made a point of letting him know that being smart wasn&#8217;t enough if your hair was uncombed, your clothes a little dirty, your skin a little ashy and your manners not the best. In other words, you may be smart,<br \/>\n but are black!<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 21<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This passage is pregnant like a rabbit with insights. Reading this not only reminded me of my own adolescence but also public treatment of <a href=\"https:\/\/gabrielledouglas.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gabrielle &#8220;Gabby&#8221; Douglas<\/a>. When she became Individual All-Around Champion at London&#8217;s 2012 Summer Olympics, Gabby was attacked for hair, not applauded for her achievements. Even in that realm of athletics, public opinion reduces Blackness to superficial appearance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap continues his discussion on US Education and US Blacks:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Education in america has to be viewed as propaganda machinery. All educational systems are propaganda machines, but for Black people, the american educational system is a propaganda machine we don&#8217;t need. It propagandizes against us. It makes us hate ourselves.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 21<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/jacques-elluls-propaganda-crowd-psychology-black-media-trust\/\" target=\"_blank\">We discuss noted scholar of propaganda, Jacques Ellul&#8217;s rules for propaganda<\/a>, and I believe H. Rap&#8217;s labeling here fits well into that framework.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He writes further:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Part of my mother&#8217;s whole attempt to make us a part of negro america was that she took us out of McKinley High and sent us to Southern High. Anybody who could pay $12 a year could go and that was for the activities card&#8230;it was really set up so the teachers at Southern wouldn&#8217;t have to send their children to school with Black kids. It was a crock of shit, but it had an air of &#8220;respectability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Busing Black children to schools outside the Black community is nothing but a move to divide the community. If integration is what&#8217;s wanted, then bus the whole community. But to take individuals out of the community is a very dangerous and immoral thing. The &#8220;brightest&#8221; students are taken, students who can fit into the white man&#8217;s program best, and they&#8217;re bused out the community so they can come back and articulate the white man&#8217;s program.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 21 &#8211; 22<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, not only is H. Rap defining this USAmerican Educational system as a propaganda machine because it &#8220;makes Blacks hate themselves&#8221;. He is also referring to how this system establishes a hierarchy of local level schools based on race. He shows how integration is less a process of social equality, but actually, another means by which US Blacks class themselves vis-a-vis a US Black collective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am one of those US Blacks that believes race is less important of a determination for loyalty than those you locally choose to be loyal to. Most of my considerations poured into US Black Media Trust is founded on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/black-media-trust\/black-race-based-fictive-kinship\/\" target=\"_blank\">my disdain<\/a> for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/black-media-trust\/3663\/\" target=\"_blank\">distant and unconditional race-based fictive kinship<\/a>. Just because two people find themselves living on same street or block does not make them &#8220;close&#8221; or &#8220;related&#8221;. I do, however, agree that if we are going to blatantly (as opposed to tacitly) group ourselves, then our schooling should be grouped as well. Any form of exclusiveness within our blatantly&#8211;that is verbally and not assumed&#8211; defined group is bound to create exclusion. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That said, I do believe that H. Rap is pointing more toward forms of Toxic Assimilation than blind fictive kinship obligations.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was always at odds with teachers. There are certain things in negro institutions that you have to do if you expect to make good grades and certain things you don&#8217;t do. One of those things is you don&#8217;t talk back.

It should also be noted, of course, Mr. James has his own social and political attitudes to address in this piece.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His discussion weaves through <i>Native Son<\/i>, finding intricate and delicately nuanced symmetry with Ms. Lorraine&#8217;s <i>Raisin<\/i>. This leads his centerpiece topic, that one element that connects both stories, in his terms, &#8220;Negro American males&#8221;, with a particular focus on his &#8220;Negro woman&#8221; given Lorraine&#8217;s overall focus in <i>Raisin<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Of &#8220;Negro American Males&#8221;,  this honored scribe notes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is dangerous to be an American Negro male. America has never wanted its Negroes to be men, and does not, generally, treat them as men. It treats them as mascots, pets, or things. Every Negro woman knows what her man faces when he goes out to work, and what poison he will probably bring back. There is no guarantee that she will always be able to suck the poison out of him; the more particularly as the male&#8217;s aspirations, and his failures, are so thoroughly bound up with herself.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 26<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While this is written in 1961, although by a Gay American Negro male, it probably will need some qualifications to be palatable across climates of various temporal sensibilities. I am sure Mr. James&#8217;s sentiment here is regarding those US Black Women(&#8220;Every Negro woman&#8221;) who are involved with US Black men. Given a man of such renown insights, I find it difficult to believe he meant to overlook every other US Black Woman who do not wish to engage men romantically, in particular, or even just US Black men. That bit of courtesy aside, I do believe it is a powerfully apt statement, especially written in 1961. Even more so, from a vantage point 56 years out, where it still rings true. Privilege and toxicity, be damned, I am sure.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do think it is only fair to consider Mr. James&#8217;s words relating to this aspect of US Black sexual politics as it informs his analysis and critique of Ms. Lorraine&#8217;s <i>Raisin<\/i>. Even his thoughts on &#8220;the male&#8217;s aspirations&#8221; must be weighted by that auspice. He concludes this review of sorts with his own ruminations of that USAmerican middle class lifestyle, and USAmerican aspirations in general.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am not myself terribly worried about color TV and split-level houses, etc., since I consider my life to be already sufficiently compromised by the garbage of this century. My own rather melancholy feeling is that as long as people want these things, they will do everything in their power to get them; when they want something better, they will make it; all I can do in the meantime, it seems to me, is attempt to prove, by hard precept and harder example, that people can be better than they are. I see no point in railing against the American middle class as such. They are a pretty sorry lot, God knows, but they are suffering here in their tawdry splendor. What one has to do, I think,<br \/>\n is undermine the standards by which they imagine themselves to live. As for the rise of the Negro into the middle class, I am not certain that what is happening in this country can be summed up quite so neatly. It doesn&#8217;t look much like a rise to me; it looks more like an insane rout, with white people fleeing to the suburbs of cities, hotly pursued by Negroes. In any case, by the time anything we can comfortably speak of as a &#8220;rise&#8221; has occurred, this country will be, for better or worse, unrecognizable.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 27<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"H.

Each generation of US Blacks born in more privileged tax brackets and social environments will be left chasing &#8220;Firsts&#8221; and fighting for Civil Rights more about inclusion in exploitative markets than actual civility. To borrow from certain lore, there is this <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yakub_(Nation_of_Islam)\" target=\"_blank\">Yakubian Theory<\/a> of trajection at work. While I do not view Whyte Supremacy as this ontologically divine(or satanic), omniscient or omnipresent force, there is an objective reality of human history to be considered. If I am allowed to borrow from yet another body of myths, Herod would be hard pressed to keep up with number of bodies piled up from murders by police of Blacks from Kennedy to Obama.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Obama, my next quote from H. Rap describes how class in Black America is codified similarly to how Whyte America codifies all of its inhabitants: along a color\/nationality spectrum.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Race prejudice in america becomes color prejudice in negro america. That which is cultural prejudice by whites against Blacks becomes class prejudice in negro america. To distinguish themselves, negroes assign class distinctions.

There are societal perks for Blacks that can claim ties to nations or have obvious signs that they are not descendents of US Slaves. There are such creative naming traditions in communities of Blacks that are less influenced by Whyte hegemony that almost immediately class a Black person that other Blacks, immigrant or privileged class, attempt to disassociate themselves from.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>H. Rap also extends his discussion on intraracial US Black classifications into socio-political and economic space with this addressing:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the white folks he works with ask him what he thinks about &#8220;the riot,&#8221; he says it&#8217;s hurting the cause and all sorts of bull like that.

A strong tool, not best or only, but damn strong, in my box of techniques is cultural criticism applied to those held in sacrosanct spaces. At times, it can be difficult to pull down idols lifted to divine status from my position, so it is necessary to call upon other gods for assistance. Such a god for me today is James Baldwin.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Mr. James&#8217;s &#8220;Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough&#8221;, he offers a media critique of Otto Preminger&#8217;s 1954 musical film, &#8220;Carmen Jones&#8221;, that stars Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte. In this media critique, Mr. James demystifies this production and outlines its class bias and color coded symbolism of morality and amorality. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I quote at length when he writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And one is not allowed to forget for an instant that one is watching an opera (a word apparently synonymous in Mr. Preminger&#8217;s mind with tragedy <i>and<\/i> fantasy), and the tone of <i>Carmen Jones<\/i> is stifling: a wedding of the blank, lofty solemnity with which Hollywood so often approaches &#8220;works of art&#8221; and the really quite helpless condescension with which Hollywood has always handled Negroes. The fact that one is watching a Negro cast interpreting <i>Carmen<\/i> is used to justify their remarkable vacuity, their complete improbability, their total divorce from anything suggestive of the realities of Negro life. On the other hand, the movie cannot possibly avoid depending very heavily on a certain quaintness, a certain lack of inhibition taken to be typical of Negroes, and further, the exigencies of the story&#8211;to say nothing of the images, which we will discuss in a moment&#8211;make it necessary to watch this movie, holding in mind three disparate ideas: (1) that this is an opera having nothing to do with the present day, hence, nothing <i>really<\/i>, to do with Negroes; but (2) the greater passion, that winning warmth (of which the movie exhibits not a trace), so typical of Negroes makes <i>Carmen<\/i> and ideal vehicle for their graduation into Art; and (3) these are <i>exceptional<\/i> Negroes, as American, that is, as you and me, interpreting lower-class Negroes of whom they, also, are very fond, an affection which is proven perhaps by the fact that everyone appears to undergo a tiny, strangling death before resolutely substituting &#8220;de&#8221; for &#8220;the.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough&#8221;, James Baldwin, essay found in &#8220;Notes Of A Native Son&#8221;, pg. 50-51<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hold up, y&#8217;all, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge that sheer wit and grace that is Mr. James&#8217;s sarcasm here.

Here, he outlines how shades of skin hue are used to create a color-coded system for character morality. In his own writing:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A movie is, literally, a series of images, and what one <i>sees<\/i> in a movie can really be taken, beyond its stammering or misleading dialogue, as the key to what the movie is actually involved in saying. <i>Carmen Jones<\/i> is one of the first and most explicit&#8211;and far and away the most self-conscious&#8211;weddings of sex and color which Hollywood had yet turned out. (It will most certainly not be the last.) From this point of view the color wheel in <i>Carmen Jones<\/i> is very important. Dorothy Dandridge&#8211;Carmen&#8211;is a sort of taffy-colored girl, very obviously and vividly dressed, but really in herself rather more sweet than vivid. One feels&#8211;perhaps one is meant to feel&#8211;that here is a <i>very<\/i> nice girl making her way in movies by means of a bad-girl part; and the glow thus caused, especially since she is a colored girl, really must make up for the glow which is missing from the performance she is clearly working very hard at. Harry Belafonte is just a little darker and just as blankly handsome and fares very badly opposite her in a really offensive version of an already unendurable role. Olga James is Micaela, here called Cindy Lou, a much paler girl than Miss Dandridge but also much plainer, who is compelled to go through the entire movie in a kind of tearful stoop. Joe Adams is Husky Miller (Escamillo) and he is also rather taffy-colored, but since he is the second lead and by way of being the villain, he is not required to be as blank as Mr. Belafonte and there is therefore, simply in his presence, some fleeting hint of masculine or at least boyish force. For the rest, Pearl Bailey is quite dark and she plays, in effect, a floozie. The wicked sergeant who causes Joe to desert the army&#8211;in one of many wildly improbable scenes&#8211;and who has evil designs on Carmen is very dark indeed; and so is Husky Miller&#8217;s trainer, who is, one is given to suppose, Miss Bailey&#8217;s sugar-daddy. It is quite clear that these people do not live in the same world with Carmen, or Joe, or Cindy Lou. All three of the leads are presented as indefinably complex and tragic, not after money or rhinestones but something else which causes them to be misunderstood by the more earthy types around them. <\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough&#8221;, James Baldwin, essay found in &#8220;Notes Of A Native Son&#8221;, pg 51-52<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Steve Johnson&#8217;s &#8216;Interface Culture&#8217; And Hypertext","content":"<p>Around 2010 or there about, I wrote a small post discussing my thoughts about content providers(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/we-write-webs\/inspiration\/dedicated-to-the-whack-writer-in-you\/\" target=\"_blank\">we still hate that word,&#8221;blogger&#8221;, huh?<\/a>) and owning multiple sites. My main concern at that time was with controlling against network effects. Fast forward seven or so years later, and I still hold to these thoughts. As a person that has operated several sites at one time, I realize that multiple domain names can be a heady task to generate content for on a regular schedule. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do, however, believe in that power of hyperlinks. Network effects is a nifty phrase that highlights social entropy. That is to say, people tend to continue their use of social sites they have built a network on as opposed to moving to other sites that are growing a network. This has created a dynamic whereby these users rarely click links(hypertext) leading outside of a domain name. Simply put, if a user is logged onto Facebook.com, most likely, they will remain on Facebook.com in some way. This phenomenon seems to occur exponentially when we factor in mobile apps. Today&#8217;s digital natives are kids in their favorite sandbox. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Legendary Ferguson activist and a long time cohort of mine, Bob Hudgins recently wrote a bit about this. I have also been reading Steven Johnson&#8217;s take on this in his book, &#8220;Interface Culture: How New Technology Transforms The Way We Create And Communicate&#8221;. In this work, Johnson compares hypertext usage in its superlative form as slang.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the mid-nineties battle over Ebonics taught us anything, it&#8217;s that the lexicon of popular idiom and slang is never quite what it appears to be on the surface.

Just as a real-world surfer&#8217;s enjoyment depended on the waves delivered up by the ocean, the channel surfer was at the mercy of the programmers and network executives.

While my hindsight on his shortsights is to be noted, it is quite noteworthy that even still in 2017, companies like Snapchat and Facebook are battling it out over dominance of video driven content.<\/p>\n<p>Continuing his praise of hypertext, he uses another symbol set borrowed from more grammatical spaces to frame them: punctuation. In his words:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The link is the first significant new form of punctuation to emerge in centuries, but it is only a hint of things to come. Hypertext, in fact, suggests a whole new grammar of possibilities, a new way of writing and telling stories.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But as a general interface convention, the link should usually be understood as a <i>synthetic<\/i> device, a tool that brings multifarious elements together into some kind of orderly unit.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 111<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>From this strategic position, he begins to lay down his arsenal of explanations regarding hypertext and link usage to define what Web can be:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Web should be a way of seeing new relationships, connecting things that might have otherwise been kept separate. Clicking on other people&#8217;s links may be less passive than the old, sendentary habits of channel surfing, but until users can create their own threads of association, there will be few genuine trailblazers on the Net.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s technologists may be too trapped within the &#8220;surfing&#8221; paradigm&#8211;clicking absentmindedly on links supplied by others&#8211;to recognize the value of being able to link back, to blaze your own trail through information-space.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 123<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Johson concludes this chapter by returning to that metaphor he initiated this stream of consciousness with:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The slang evolves out of the way you string together information, the way you make your references, and not the words you use.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 136<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Douglas Rushkoff&#8217;s &#8217;10 Commands For A Digital Age&#8217; And Black Media Trust","content":"<p>Communication as a toy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Communication as a tool<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Communication as a weapon.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It can be difficult to use a medium most used to not only present and promote stereotypes, but one that has for decades successfully sold stereotype as product.

In Rushkoff&#8217;s manifesto, &#8220;PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED: Ten Commands for a Digital Age&#8221;, he outlines ten rules to guide how media trust should be applied in online spaces. Each rule in his outline is fleshed out with practical reasoning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I quote at length here:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I. TIME<\/p>\n<p>Do Not Be Always On<\/p>\n<p>The spirit of the digital age still finds its expression in this reappropriation of time. Our cutting and pasting, mash-ups and remixes, satires and send-ups all originate in this ability to pause, reflect, and rework.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We work against the powerful bias of a timeless technology, and create a situation in which it is impossible to keep up. And so we sacrifice the thoughtfulness and deliberateness our digital media once offered for the false goal of immediacy\u2014as if we really can exist in a state of perpetual standby.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The results aren\u2019t pretty. Instead of becoming empowered and aware, we become frazzled and exhausted. We have no time to make considered responses, feeling instead obligated to reply to every incoming message on impulse. We reduce the length and complexity of our responses from paragraphs to sentences to txts, making almost everything we transmit sound like orders barked over a walkie-talkie in a war zone. Everything must happen right away or, better, now. There is no later. This works against the no-time bias of digital media, and so it works against us, even though it might work for the phone company programming the device and inducing our dependence and compliance. (Yes, each variety of beep is studied and tested for its ability to entrain our behavior.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yet this very discomfort and anxiety compels us to seek still more: The possibility of one great email from a friend, or one good contract offer somewhere down in that list of unanswered messages keeps us compulsively checking our inboxes, iPhones and BlackBerrys like classically conditioned gamblers at the slot machines.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the networking of the dendrites in our skulls that matters so much as how effective and happy we are living that way and, in the case of digital media, how purposefully we get ourselves there. Recognizing the biases of the technologies we bring into our lives is really the only way to stay aware of the ways we are changing in order to accommodate them, and to gauge whether we are happy with that arrangement. Rather than accepting each tool\u2019s needs as a necessary compromise in our passively technologized lifestyles, we can instead exploit those very same leanings to make ourselves more human.<br \/>\nOur computers live in the ticks of the clock. We live in the big spaces between those ticks, when the time actually passes. By becoming \u201calways on,\u201d we surrender time to a technology that knows and needs no such thing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>II. PLACE<\/p>\n<p>Live in Person<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While the intent of digital networks was not to disconnect a high school girl from her real world friendships, the bias of the networks were absolutely intended to favor decentralized activity. After all, the net was developed as a communications platform capable of withstanding nuclear attack. Messages\u2014whether text, audio, or video\u2014move through the network as \u201cpackets,\u201d each taking different routes from node to node until they find their destination. The network is still controlled centrally by an authority (we\u2019ll get to this later), but it functions in a decentralized way.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a result, digital media are biased away from the local, and toward dislocation. Just as television is better at broadcasting a soccer game occurring on the other side of the world than it is at broadcasting the pillow talk of the person next to you in bed, the net is better at creating simulations and approximations of human interaction from a great distance than it is at fostering interactions between people in the same place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Technology and media traditionally worked to make commerce more global, favoring big business over local interests. Mass production distanced workers from the value they were creating. Instead of making a product from beginning to end, each worker on an assembly line completed one small task in the overall process. The product moves from person to person\u2014or even nation to nation\u2014as it is assembled. Each person means less to the production cycle. One\u2019s skill level becomes less important as repeatable processes replace craftsmanship and expertise. Workers become cheaper and replaceable, while corporate pricing power puts local companies out of business. Towns become ever more dependent on foreign-owned factories for employment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mass-produced products require mass marketing to sell them. Instead of buying oats from Bob the miller, people\u2014now \u201cconsumers\u201d\u2014were to purchase them from a big company a thousand miles away in Ohio. The face of a Quaker on the package helped to re-create the kind of bond people used to enjoy with the fellow community members with whom they previously exchanged goods. Finally, a mass media arose to promote these long-distance brand images to an entire nation. Through radio and television, non-local companies could seed a market with their brands and mythologies before the package even made it to the shelf.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While cable television and, now, Internet marketing give smaller businesses a way to peddle their wares in the same media as their corporate counterparts, it may actually work against their real strength as real world, local companies. The power of a local business\u2014or any local enterprise\u2014is its connection to a particular region and people. Its locality is its strength. By turning to a decentralized medium to engage with people right around the corner, a local business loses its home field advantage. Its banner ads will never look as good as those coming out of a marketing agency anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This misguided tendency to depend on long-distance technology to enhance up-close encounters is completely understandable and forgivable. The more connected we feel in digital spaces, the less securely connected many of us feel in real ones. After days or weeks connecting with people through video chats, the sensation of someone\u2019s eyes actually looking into our own in real life can be overwhelming and disorienting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By recognizing digital media\u2019s bias for dislocation, we are enabled to exploit its strength delivering interactivity over long distances, while preserving our ability to engage without its interference when we want to connect locally. Many businesses\u2014particularly the biggest ones\u2014already exist in a non-local reality. The entire history of industrial corporatism, from colonial empires to the railroad barons of the nineteenth century, depended on disconnecting people from their local strength and commanding them from afar. For them, it is just as ridiculous to use the net to feign that they are local enterprises as it is for local enterprises to use it to act in the manner of national brands. Powerful global companies become weak local ones, while promising local companies become weak global players.<br \/>\nThe digital age offers us all the opportunity to recognize the dislocating bias of our interactive media. With that knowledge, we may choose when we wish to live and work in real places, with one another and\u2014unique to living humans\u2014in person.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>III. CHOICE<\/p>\n<p>You May Always Choose None of the Above<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We all want the freedom to choose, and the history of technology can easily be told as the story of how human beings gave themselves more choices: the choice to live in different climates, to spend our time doing things other than hunting for food, to read at night, and so on. Still, there\u2019s a value set attending all this choice, and the one choice we\u2019re not getting to make is whether or not to deal with all this choice.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s an online bookstore suggesting books based on our previous selections (and those of thousands of other consumers with similar choice histories), or a consumer research firm using kids\u2019 social networking behaviors to predict which ones will someday self-identify as gay (yes, they can do that now), choice is less about giving people what they want than getting them to take what the choice-giver has to sell.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Withholding choice is not death. Quite on the contrary, it is one of the few things distinguishing life from its digital imitators.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IV. COMPLEXITY<\/p>\n<p>You Are Never Completely Right<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to its first three biases, digital technology encourages us to make decisions, make them in a hurry, and make them about things we\u2019ve never seen for ourselves up close. Furthermore, because these choices must all be expressed in numbers, they are only accurate to the nearest decimal place. They are approximations by necessity. But they are also absolute: At the end of the day, digital technologies are saying either yes or no.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yes, thanks to the digital archive we can retrieve any piece of data on our own terms, but we do so at the risk of losing its context. Our knee-jerk, digital age reaction against academic disciplines finds its footing in our resentment for centuries of repressive hierarchies. Professors, gurus, and pundits made us pay for access to their knowledge, in one way or another. Still, although they may have abused their monopolies, some of the journeys on which they sent us were valid. The academic disciplines were developed over centuries, as each new era of experts added to and edited the body of what they considered to be essential knowledge. By abandoning the disciplines\u2014however arbitrarily they may have been formulated\u2014we disconnect ourselves from the multigenerational journey leading up to this moment. We are no longer part of that bigger project, or even know what it is we are rejecting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>This makes digital technology\u2014and those of us using it\u2014biased toward a reduction of complexity.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&#038;nbsp<\/p>\n<p>In the more immediate sense, facts devoid of context are almost impossible to apply sensibly. They become the fodder for falsely constructed arguments of one side or other of the social or political spectrum. The single vote of a politician is used to describe his entire record, a single positive attribute of caffeine or tobacco receives attention thanks to public relations funding, and a picture of a single wounded child turns public opinion against one side in a conflict rather than against war itself.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Both sides in a debate can cherry-pick the facts that suit them\u2014enraging their constituencies and polarizing everybody. In a digital culture that values data points over context, everyone comes to believe they have the real answer and that the other side is crazy or evil. Once they reach this point, it no longer matters that the opposing side\u2019s facts contradict one\u2019s own: True believers push through to a new level of cynicism where if the facts are contradictory, it means they are all irrelevant. The abundance of facts ends up reducing their value to us.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a result, we tend to retreat into tribes, guided primarily by our uninformed rage. And we naturally hunger for reinforcement. Television news shows rise to the occasion, offering shouting matches between caricatured opposites competing for ratings. Elected officials are ridiculed as \u201cwonks\u201d for sharing or even understanding multiple viewpoints, the history of an issue, or its greater context. We forget that these are the people we\u2019re paying to learn about these issues on our behalf. Instead, we overvalue our own opinions on issues about which we are ill informed, and undervalue those who are telling us things that are actually more complex than they look on the surface. They become the despised \u201celite.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Models are necessarily reductive. They are limited by design. This does not negate their usefulness; it merely qualifies it. Digital reduction yields maps. These maps are great for charting a course, but they are not capable of providing the journey. No matter how detailed or interactive the map gets, it cannot replace the territory.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>V. SCALE<\/p>\n<p>One Size Does Not Fit All<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>On the net, everything scales\u2014or at least it\u2019s supposed to. Digital technologies are biased toward abstraction, bringing everything up and out to the same universal level. People, ideas, and businesses that don\u2019t function on that level are disadvantaged, while those committed to increasing levels of abstraction tend to dominate. By remembering that one size does not fit all, we can preserve local and particular activities in the face of demands to scale up.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>On the net, everything is occurring on the same abstracted and universal level. Survival in a purely digital realm\u2014particularly in business\u2014means being able to scale, and winning means being able to move up one level of abstraction beyond everyone else. <\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Because the net is occurring on a single, oversimplified and generic level, success has less to do with finding a niche than establishing a \u201cvertical\u201d or a \u201chorizontal.\u201d Going vertical means establishing oneself as the place to do everything in a particular industry: the one-stop place for hardware, or cycling needs, or home electronics. Going horizontal means to offer a service that applies to every category\u2019s transactions&#8230;. In either case, \u201cscaling up\u201d means cutting through the entire cloud in one direction or another: becoming all things to some people, or some things to all people.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What all this abstraction does accomplish here on earth, however, is make everyone and everything more dependent on highly centralized standards. Instead of granting power to small businesses on the periphery, the net ends up granting even more authority to the central authorities, indexers, aggregators, and currencies through which all activity must pass. Without the search engine, we are lost. Without centrally directed domain name servers, the search engines are lost. Further, since digital content itself needs to be coded and decoded, it requires tremendous standardization from the outset. Far from liberating people and their ideas from hierarchies, the digital realm enforces central control on an entirely new level.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Activism means finding a website, joining a movement, or \u201cliking\u201d a cause\u2014all of which exist on a plane above and beyond their human members. Learning, orienting, and belonging online depend on universally accepted symbols or generically accessible institutions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Abstraction has been around since language, perhaps even before. Money, math, theology, and games would all be impossible without abstracted symbol systems, accepted standards, and some measure of central authority. The digital realm is no different in that regard.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>VI. IDENTITY<\/p>\n<p>Be Yourself<\/p>\n<p>Our digital experiences are out-of-body. This biases us toward depersonalized behavior in an environment where one\u2019s identity can be a liability. But the more anonymously we engage with others, the less we experience the human repercussions of what we say and do. By resisting the temptation to engage from the apparent safety of anonymity, we remain accountable and present\u2014and much more likely to bring our humanity with us into the digital realm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In a hostile, depersonalized net environment, identity is one\u2019s liability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>The less we take responsibility for what we say and do online, the more likely we are to behave in ways that reflect our worst natures\u2014or even the worst natures of others. Because digital technology is biased toward depersonalization, we must make an effort not to operate anonymously, unless absolutely necessary. We must be ourselves.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t put words into the digital realm unless we are willing to own them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>VII. SOCIAL<\/p>\n<p>Do Not Sell Your Friends<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In spite of its many dehumanizing tendencies, digital media is still biased toward the social. In the ongoing coevolution between people and technologies, tools that connect us thrive\u2014and tools that don\u2019t connect us soon learn to. We must remember that the bias of digital media is toward contact with other people, not with their content or, worse, their cash. If we don\u2019t, we risk robbing ourselves of the main gift digital technology has to offer us in return for our having created it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Almost immediately after the first computer networks were developed for Defense Department use, their system operators noticed something strange: the scientists who had accounts were spending more time and bandwidth talking about their personal research interests and favorite science fiction novels than official business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While the Internet\u2014then Arpanet\u2014was a technological success, it had become overwhelmed by social use. The government decided to give it away. AT&#038;T turned down the offer to take it over. In what may have ultimately been a kind of wisdom, they couldn\u2019t see a business application for what appeared to be an academic social scene. The government ended up setting the net free, to a large extent, with the proviso that it only be used for research purposes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No one thought the net would end up going anywhere\u2014not least of which because people conversing with one another over networks seemed to be a financial dead end. The net was compared to Citizens Band radio\u2014a two-year fad that faded even before a movie about the truck drivers\u2019 lingo and culture could be shot and released. My own first Internet book was actually canceled by the publisher in 1992 because they thought the net would be \u201cover\u201d by 1993, when the book would finally hit the shelves.<br \/>\nThe social, noncommercial net continued to grow and grow. By 1994, studies showed that families owning a computer modem were watching an average of nine hours less television per week. Worse, at least to marketers, they were spending it in a completely commercial-free medium. Finally, after a series of violations by small businesses looking to promote their services online, the net was opened for commercial use. Legislators used the argument that it couldn\u2019t be held back effectively anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Friendships, both digital and incarnate, do create value. But this doesn\u2019t mean the people in our lives can be understood as commodities to be collected and counted. People are not things to be sold piecemeal, but living members of a network whose value can only be realized in a free-flowing and social context. We have yet to find out what that value might be.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Content was never king, contact is. Yet the possibilities for new levels of human connectedness and collaboration offered by networking technologies have hardly been tapped. We are too slow to realize that people are not a form of content\u2014a resource to be bought and sold; they are fellow cells in the greater organism of which we are all a part but are barely aware. We value our increased contacts for what they might provide and miss the greater value of the contact itself.<br \/>\nBut it is this contact, this desire to construct a social organism together, that has been the driving force of digital technology all along. The instinct for increased contact is the evolutionary imperative we feel to become something greater than ourselves. Just as atoms combined into molecules, molecules clustered into cells, and cells collected into organisms, we organisms are networking into greater levels of organization.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is the real draw of the many interactive devices we have brought into our lives. In a sense, the people dismissing the net as another form of CB radio had it right: We are still just finding novel ways of talking to one another. From the ridiculous faxes people used to send to each other containing lists of bad jokes to the tweets we now transmit by cell phone, each new communications technology provides a new excuse to forge connections.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The content is not the message, the contact is. The ping itself. It\u2019s the synaptic transmission of an organism trying to wake itself up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>VIII. FACT<br \/>\nTell the Truth<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>The network is like a truth serum: Put something false online and it will eventually be revealed as a lie. Digital technology is biased against fiction and toward facts, against story and toward reality. This means the only option for those communicating in these spaces is to tell the truth.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We all have relatives who mistakenly pass on ridiculous viral emails about corporations that will give a donation of a million dollars if you pass the email to others, or a kid in a hospital who needs a blood transfusion, or a threatening virus that will eat your data if you don\u2019t shut down you computer immediately. It\u2019s sweet that they want to share with us; it\u2019s just a shame they don\u2019t have anything real to share. Viral media fills this need for them, giving them fake facts with which to feed digital media\u2019s bias for nonfiction contact.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Those who succeed as communicators in the new bazaar will be the ones who can quickly evaluate what they\u2019re hearing, and learn to pass on only the stuff that matters. These are the people who create more signal and less noise, and become the most valued authorities in a digital media. But the real winners will once again be those who actually discover and innovate\u2014the people who do and find things worthy of everyone else\u2019s attention. They\u2019re the ones who give us not only good excuses to send messages to one another, but also real ways for us all to create more value for one another.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The way to flourish in a mediaspace biased toward nonfiction is to tell the truth. This means having a truth to tell.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>IX. OPENNESS<br \/>\nShare, Don\u2019t Steal<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Digital networks were built for the purpose of sharing computing resources by people who were themselves sharing resources, technologies, and credit in order to create it. This is why digital technology is biased in favor of openness and sharing. Because we are not used to operating in a realm with these biases, however, we often exploit the openness of others or end up exploited ourselves. By learning the difference between sharing and stealing, we can promote openness without succumbing to selfishness.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>X. PURPOSE<br \/>\nProgram or Be Programmed<\/p>\n<p><i>Digital technology is programmed. This makes it biased toward those with the capacity to write the code. In a digital age, we must learn how to make the software, or risk becoming the software. It is not too difficult or too late to learn the code behind the things we use\u2014or at least to understand that there is code behind their interfaces. Otherwise, we are at the mercy of those who do the programming, the people paying them, or even the technology itself.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Instead of teaching programming, most schools with computer literacy curriculums teach programs. Kids learn how to use popular spreadsheet, word processing, and browsing software so that they can operate effectively in the high-tech workplace. These basic skills may make them more employable for the entry-level cubicle jobs of today, but they will not help them adapt to the technologies of tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Their bigger problem is that their entire orientation to computing will be from the perspective of users. When a kid is taught a piece of software as a subject, she\u2019ll tend to think of it like any other thing she has to learn. Success means learning how to behave in the way the program needs her to. Digital technology becomes the immutable thing, while the student is the movable part, conforming to the needs of the program in order to get a good grade on the test.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i> Programming is the sweet spot, the high leverage point in a digital society. If we don\u2019t learn to program, we risk being programmed ourselves.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Early computers were built by hackers, whose own biases ended up being embedded in their technologies. Computers naturally encouraged a hacker\u2019s approach to media and technology. They made people less interested in buying media and a bit more interested in making and breaking it. They also turned people\u2019s attention away from sponsored shows and toward communicating and sharing with one another. The problem was that all this communicating and sharing was bad for business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So the people investing in software and hardware development sought to discourage this hacker\u2019s bias by making interfaces more complex.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Fully open and customizable operating systems, like Linux, are much more secure than closed ones such as Microsoft Windows. In fact, the back doors that commercial operating systems leave for potential vendors and consumer research have made them more vulnerable to attack than their open source counterparts. This threat is compounded by the way commercial vendors keep their source code a secret. We aren\u2019t even to know the ways we are vulnerable. We are but to trust. Even the Pentagon is discouraged from developing its own security protocols through the Linux platform, by a Congress heavily lobbied to promote Windows.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Like the military, we are to think of our technologies in terms of the applications they offer right out of the box instead of how we might change them or write our own. We learn what our computers already do instead of what we can make them do. This isn\u2019t even the way a kid naturally approaches a video game. Sure, a child may play the video game as it\u2019s supposed to be played for a few dozen or hundred hours. When he gets stuck, what does he do? He goes online to find the \u201ccheat codes\u201d for the game. Now, with infinite ammunition or extra-strength armor, he can get through the entire game. Is he still playing the game? Yes, but from outside the confines of the original rules. He\u2019s gone from player to cheater.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Until push comes to shove and geopolitics force us to program or perish, however, we will likely content ourselves with the phone apps and social networks on offer.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For those who do learn to program see the rest of the world differently as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;PROGRAM OR BE PROGRAMMED:Ten Commands for a Digital Age&#8221;, Douglas Rushkoff(2010)<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Kevin Spacey Of House Of Cards On Television Beyond Television","content":"<p><center><video src=\"https:\/\/owlasylum.net\/on_modern_media_its_the_creatives_stupid.mp4\" width=\"100%\" poster=\"https:\/\/owlasylum.net\/kvn_spcy.png\" controls><br \/>\n<\/video><\/center><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In what I believe is a keynote address, Kevin Spacey addresses medium as message in respect to world of television.

We are all more able to reach audiences via every device, including that big flat screen in living rooms nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While I am growing to detest time as a synonym for &#8220;progress&#8221;, I thought his anecdote detailing how his team sold &#8220;House Of Cards&#8221; to Netflix was telling.

No one seriously defends the deep mediation of the contemporary electoral process, with its image makers and spin doctors and sound bites, and its candidates selected more for their skill with an open mike than their legislative record. But modern imagineering should provoke more than just empty nostalgia for a kinder, less-mediated America. For the older critics of image society, the false god of television is cause for endless hand-wringing, for long, contemplative essays on the decline of the stump speech and the kissing of babies. For the new parasite forms, however, the society of the spectacle is a call to arms. Instead of muttering &#8220;the emperor has no clothes&#8221; from the sidelines, they&#8217;ve stripped naked and jumped aboard the mass-media float.

In other words, the relationship governed by the interface is a <i>semantic<\/i> one, characterized by meaning and expression rather than physical force. Digital computers are &#8220;literary machines,&#8221; as hypertext guru Ted Nelson calls them. They work with signs and symbols, although this language, in its most elemental form, is almost impossible to understand. A computer thinks&#8211;if thinking is the right word for it&#8211;in tiny pulses of electricity, representing either an &#8220;on&#8221; or an &#8220;off&#8221; state, a zero or a one. Humans think in words, concepts, images, sounds, associations. A computer that does nothing but manipulate sequences of zeros and ones is nothing but an exceptionally inefficient adding machine. For the magic of the digital revolution to take place, a computer must also <i>represent itself<\/i> to the user, in a language that the user understands.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Interface Culture: How New Technology Transforms The Way We Create And Communicate.&#8221;, Steven Johnson,pg 14<\/cite><br \/>\n<\/quoteblock><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere I have discussed semiotics, culture, and race.

If those design and technology leaders at XEROX PARC in 1960s and 1970s had all been influenced by either Dr. King, Jr, Malcolm X, Ella Baker, or Fannie Lou Hammer in an identitarian manner, what sorts of programs would have initially come with Apple and Microsoft&#8217;s versions of their work?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While I embrace a much more abstracted definition and understanding of interface that you can read here, I do understand exactly what Mr. Johnson is suggesting in this passage.

Do not feel bad about that, I now reside in comfy and cozy Baltimore, MD. No, that is actually an upgrade. I kid, well, slightly. Given that I spent most of my life in an area I do not live in, those few lucky souls blessed to call me their friend have limited recourse to my time. That means I spend a considerable amount of time on phone calls making sure our bonds are secure.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, backstory out of our way, right?

I was honestly flabergasted, but it did make me think of those millions of US Blacks in areas where performing race in a particular way is their only means of balancing inequality at their workplace. It put me in mind of a book entitled, &#8220;Acting White?: Rethinking Race in &#8216;Post-Racial&#8217; America&#8221;,  written by Devon W.

Failure to work one\u2019s identity can result in losing elections, unpleasant and even deadly interactions with law enforcement, losing out on jobs, being passed over for promotions, and denial of admission to educational institutions. The disadvantages are not a product of simply being black. They are a product of how black a decision maker perceives a particular person to be. In this respect, what we describe is not so much an interracial discrimination problem (decision makers preferring whites over blacks) but rather an intraracial discrimination problem (decision makers preferring some blacks over others).<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Acting White?: Rethinking Race in &#8216;Post-Racial&#8217; America&#8221;, Devon W.

Nothing deep or philosophical. Th ink of identity as falling into one of two categories: sense of self identity (how we define and perceive ourselves) and ascriptive identity (how others define and perceive us). Admittedly, this distinction is artificial because how we see ourselves is shaped by how others see us. For example, a person\u2019s view of herself as outgoing, creative, and witty is based in part on other people experiencing her in those ways. Nevertheless, the distinction helps, if only because, at the end of the day, most of us do develop particular views of ourselves. We sometimes call this our self-image. While one\u2019s self-image can certainly change over time, at any given moment, we are likely to have one. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This chapter places these definitions of identity in the context of a broader discussion about race and professional identity in the workplace. We argue that because people of color often perceive themselves the subjects of negative stereotyping, they are likely to feel the need to do significant amounts of identity work to counter those stereotypes. What is worse, these stereotypes are often in tension with the institutional norms around which the workplace is organized. As a result of this tension, persons of color must master the ability to negotiate between their sense of self and their sense of who the institution wants them to be. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 24<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These authors use another term in their framing to discuss that act of compromising one&#8217;s principles in order to assimilate.

This reminds me of Marxist writer Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s prison notes regarding US Blacks assimilating as course for survival.

He writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The aristocracy longed for a way to participate in the new economy&#8211;a way to invest that didn&#8217;t put them or their good names at any risk.

She takes our hands and apparates with us to December 1889. Van Gogh is writing a letter at a desk too small. She reads us his letter. Afterward, she explains why she has magically lifted us to this place:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Six months later, Van Gogh&#8211;whose health was &#8220;improving a great deal&#8221;&#8211;committed suicide. He had sold one painting during his lifetime. Three times was his work noticed in the press. But these are just details.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The real Vincent Van Gogh is the man who has &#8220;just done five size 30 canvasses, olive trees.&#8221; To me, in context, one of the most moving and revealing descriptions of how a real artist thinks. And the knowledge that when he spoke of &#8220;suffering under an absolute lack of models&#8221; he spoke of that lack in terms of both the intensity of his commitment and the quality and singularity of his work, which was frequently ridiculed in his day.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The absence of models, in literature as in life, to say nothing of painting, is an occupational hazard for the artist, simply because models in art, in behavior, in growth of spirit and intellect&#8211;even if rejected&#8211;enrich and enlarge one&#8217;s view of existence. Deadlier still, to the artist who lacks models, is the curse of ridicule, the bringing to bear on an artist&#8217;s best work, especially his or her most original, most striking deviant, only a fund of ignorance and the presumption that, as an artist&#8217;s critic, one&#8217;s judgment is free of the restrictions imposed by prejudice, and is well informed, indeed, about all the art in the world that really matters.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 4-5<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Alice brings home her driving point for this introductory set of statements with:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is always needed in the appreciation of art, or life, is the larger perspective. Connections made, or at least attempted, where none existed before, the straining to encompass in one&#8217;s glance at the varied world the common thread, the unifying theme through immense diversity, a fearlessness of growth, of search, of looking, that enlarges the private and the public world. And yet, in our particular society, it is the narrowed and narrowing view of life that often wins.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 5<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Alice takes a step away from Van Gogh&#8217;s kiddie writing desk, transporting us to a university circuit reading. At this reading, she is asked to differentiate between US Black authors and US Whyte authors. Her initial internal response is balanced in an annoyed way. She considers her own thoughts regarding art and her view of written works as one story composed by many writers. She does, possibly to humor her inquirer, distinguish certain treatments of death and struggle observed in these writings based on racial distinctions.<\/p>\n<p>While she admits that her &#8220;comparison does not hold up in every case&#8221;, she cite two books that do work to assist her analogy of forms: <i>The Awakening<\/i>, by Kate Chopin and <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God<\/i>, by Zora Neale Hurston. She goes to explain how many in her audience were unaware of any of Zora&#8217;s work. It is, of course, Alice who resurrects Ms. Zora out of obscurity. Through this essay, she explains exactly that bit of US Black Woman&#8217;s conjuring occurred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So when I sat down to write my story about voodoo, my crazy Walker aunt was definitely on my mind.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But she had experienced her temporary craziness so long ago that her story had all the excitement of a might-have-been. I needed, instead of family memories, some hard facts about the <i>craft<\/i> of voodoo, as practiced by Southern blacks in the nineteenth century. (It never once, fortunately, occurred to me that voodoo was not worthy of the interest I had in it, or was too ridiculous to study seriously.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I began reading all I could find on the subject of &#8220;The Negro and His Folkways and Superstitions.&#8221; There were Botkin and Puckett and others, all white, most racist.

Where is the <i>black<\/i> anthropologist? Where is the <i>black<\/i> person who took the time to travel the back roads of the South and collect the information I need: how to cure heart trouble, treat dropsy, hex somebody to death, lock bowels, cause joints to swell, eyes to fall out, and so on. Where was this black person?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And that is when I first saw, in a <i>footnote<\/i> to the white voices of authority, the name Zora Neale Hurston.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 11<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Alice connects her introduction to this climatic device by writing:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I had discovered, of course, was a model. A model, who, as it happened, provided more than voodoo for my story, more than one of the greatest novels America had produced&#8211;though, being America, it did not realize this. She had provided, as if she knew someday I would come along wandering in the wilderness, a nearly complete record of her life.

Another artist whose travels extend to and fro Southern Florida and Harlem Renaissance, dying in squalor despite her stunning, shining storytelling.

Janis&#8217;s &#8216;Groupthink&#8217;, Anti-Critical Thinking, And Black Media Trust","content":"<p>There are a number of factors, social elements, and internal dynamics of character that I could label as anti-critical thinking. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/we-write-webs\/inspiration\/all-the-groupthinkers-get-down-on-the-floor\/\" target=\"_blank\">In a post I wrote half a decade ago, I listed several reasons why Erykah Badu&#8217;s use of &#8220;groupthink&#8221; was a form of anti-critical thinking. In that piece, I quoted an author, psychologist, and person responsible for coining that term, &#8220;groupthink&#8221;.<\/a> In his book, &#8220;Victims Of Groupthink&#8221;, Irving Janis lays out a set of definitions, a study of high-level policy makers in group decision making situations, and an overall framework to discuss groupthink as a factor of group dynamics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Janis selects four US foreign policy fiascoes to illustrate his hypothesis and framework for defining groupthink as an explanation for such displays of anti-critical thinking.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I use the term &#8220;groupthink&#8221; as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members&#8217; striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action. &#8220;Groupthink&#8221; is a term of the same order as the words in the newspeak vocabulary of George Orwell presents in his dismaying <i>1984<\/i>&#8211;a vocabulary with terms such as &#8220;doublethink&#8221; and &#8220;crimethink&#8221;. By putting groupthink with those Orwellian words, I realize that groupthink takes on an invidious connotation. The invidiousness is intentional: Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Victims Of Groupthink&#8221;, Irving L. Janis, pg. 9<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Janis continues his discussion by listing what he refers to as six major defects of decision making:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At least six major defects in decision-making contribute to failures to solve problems adequately. First, the group&#8217;s discussions are limited to a few alternative courses of action (often only two) without a survey of the full range of alternatives. Second, the group fails to reexamine the course of action initially preferred by the majority of members from the standpoint of nonobvious risks and drawbacks that had not been considered when it was originally evaluated. Third, the members neglect courses of action initially evaluated as unsatisfactory by the majority of the group: they spend little or no time discussing whether they have overlooked nonobvious gains or whether there are ways of reducing the seemingly prohibitive costs that had made the alternatives seem undesirable. Fourth, members make little or no attempt to obtain information from experts who can supply sound estimates of losses and gains to be expected from alternative courses of actions. Fifth, selective bias is shown in the way the group reacts to factual information and relevant judgments from experts, the mass media, and outside critics. The members show interest in facts and opinions that support their initially preferred policy and take up time in their meetings to discuss them, but they tend to ignore facts and opinions that do not support their initially preferred policy. Sixth, the members spend little time deliberating about how the chosen policy might be hindered by bureaucratic inertia, sabotaged by political opponents, or temporarily derailed by the common accidents that happen to the best of well-laid plans. Consequently, they fail to work out contingency plans to cope with foreseeable setbacks that could endanger the overall success of the chosen course of action.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 10<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A key point in his discussion is highlighted when he describes his initial findings. In this hypothesis, he points to a dynamic where loyalty to a group overshadowing critical thinking and objectivity in decisions made by that group lead to detrimental decision making by that group.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his own words:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;a dominant characteristic appears to be remaining loyal to the group by sticking with the decisions to which the group has committed itself, even when the policy is working badly and has unintended consequences that disturb the conscience of the members. In a sense, members consider loyalty to the group the highest form of morality. That loyalty requires each member to avoid raising controversial issues, questioning weak arguments, or calling a halt to softheaded thinking.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Paradoxically, softheaded groups are likely to be extremely hardhearted toward out-groups and enemies. In dealing with a rival nation, policy-makers comprising an amiable group find it relatively easy to authorize dehumanizing solutions such as large-scale bombings. An affable group of government officials is unlikely to pursue the difficult and controversial issues that arise when alternatives to a harsh military solution come up for discussion. Nor are the members inclined to raise ethical issues that imply that this &#8220;fine group of ours, with its humanitarianism and its high-minded principles, might be capable of adopting a course of action that is inhumane and immoral.&#8221;<br \/>\n<cite>pg. 12<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To his credit, Janis extends an enormous amount of energy in qualifying exactly what he wishes to point towards with his term, &#8220;groupthink&#8221;. That he attempts to establish this as early in his book fits within his overall tendency towards clarity. His work details readily that groupthink is not an attribute of individual error or structural error, that is, when it is a cause of error.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The concept of groupthink pinpoints an entirely different source of trouble, residing neither in the individual nor in the organization setting. Over and beyond all the familiar sources of human error is a powerful source of defective judgment that arises in cohesive groups &#8212; the concurrence-seeking tendency, which fosters overoptimism, lack of vigilance, and sloganistic thinking about the weakness and immorality of out-groups. This tendency can take its toll even when the decision-makers are conscientious statesmen trying to make the best possible decisions for their country and for all mankind.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 13<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Janis leaves us with his most resolute definition for groupthink:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>The more amiability and esprit de corps among the members of a policy-making in-group, the greater is the danger that independent critical thinking will be replaced by groupthink, which is likely to result in irrational and dehumanizing actions directed against out-groups.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><cite><\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is an attractiveness in using a term whose labeling is inspired by popular culture. However, there is a concomitant danger there as well. That being, a misuse based less on popular usage than lack of ever seeking to research context that gave impetus to its coinage. This is not OWL subscribing to practices of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vox.com\/videos\/2017\/3\/14\/14887560\/dictionary-english-kory-stamper-lexicographer\" target=\"_blank\">etymological fallicists<\/a>. Moreso, it is OWL bringing awareness to a framework that addresses that sort of anti-critical thinking that US Black Media Trust is specifically designed to tackle. While Janis applies his work in a way that poignantly averts any attempt at misusage, it ultimately gets misused, mainly because of how it sits in popular culture. However, his use of four high-level state department fiascoes is to make sure misreadings regarding what sort of group of individuals this phrase should be applied to do not creep into this framework.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For my usage here, it must be noted again that groupthink does apply to in person, high-level group decision making, mainly as a means of qualification. Groupthink is not used to consider group influence on people without power where class is a major determinant, as Janis uses government officials in military decision making criteria and members of one of Earth&#8217;s power nations. What I do believe I will ponder based on Janis&#8217;s study for my own work, is how people in groups formed purely in mediated space behave in similar fashion to those described in his studies of groupthink.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Kropotkin&#8217;s &#8216;Anarchist Communism&#8217;","content":"<p>As I discussed in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/prince-peter-kropotkins-spirit-revolt-cyborg-fantasies-black-media-trust\/\" target=\"_blank\">another article, Peter Kropotkin used essays that he transcribed into pamphlets as a means to extend his voice.<\/a> One of many points of view extended through these writings was his ideas on government, or lack thereof.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In a collection of his writings compiled by Roger N.

The anarchist thinker does not resort to metaphysical conceptions (like &#8220;natural rights,&#8221; the &#8220;duties fo the State,&#8221; and so on) to establish what are, in his opinion, the best conditions for realizing the greatest happiness of humanity. He follows, on the contrary, the course traced by the modern philosophy of evolution. He studies human society as it is now and was in the past; and without either endowing humanity as a whole, or separate individuals, with superior qualities which they do not possess, he merely considers society as an aggregation of organisms trying to find out the best ways of combining the wants of the individual with those of cooperation for the welfare of the species. He studies society and tries to discover its <i>tendencies<\/i>, past and present, its growing needs, intellectual and economic, and in his ideal he merely points out in which direction evolution goes. He distinguishes between the real wants and tendencies of human aggregations and the accidents (wants of knowledge, migrations, wars, conquests) which have prevented these tendencies from being satisfied. And he concludes that the two most prominent, although often unconscious, tendencies throughout our history have been: first, a tendency towards integrating labor for the production of all riches in common, so as finally to render it impossible to discriminate the part of the common production due to the separate individual; and second, a tendency towards the fullest freedom of the individual in the prosecution of all aims, beneficial both for himself and for society at large. The ideal of the anarchist is thus a mere summing-up of what he considers to be the next phase of evolution. It is no longer a matter fo faith; it is a matter for scientific discussion.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Kropotkin&#8217;s Revolutionary Pamphlets: A Collection Of Writings By Peter Kropotkin&#8221;, Edited By Roger N.

But these concessions, unsupported as they were by corresponding changes in economic relations, proved delusions. They did not materially improve the conditions of the great bulk of the workmen.

Representative government has also been reduced to its real value&#8211;that of an instrument which has rendered services in the struggle against autocracy, but not an ideal of free political organization.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 51<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Further in this essay, he picks up his chastisement of reform thinkers of his time. It should be noted just how similar these types of politically uninspired persons where to their modern day counterparts:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;the anarchist says to the political reformer: &#8220;No substantial reform in the sense of political equality and no limitation of the powers fo government can be made as long as society is divided into two hostile camps, and the laborer remains, economically speaking, a slave to his employer.&#8221; But to the state socialist we say also: &#8220;You cannot modify at the same time the political organization. You must limit the powers of government and renounce parliamentary rule. To each new economic phase of life corresponds a new political phase. Absolute monarchy corresponded to the system of serfdom. Representative government corresponds to capital-rule. Both, however, are class-rule. But in a society where the distinction between capitalist and laborer has disappeared, there is no need of such a government; it would be an anachronism, a nuisance. Free workers would require a free organization, and this cannot have any other basis than free agreement and free cooperation, without sacrificing the autonomy of the individual to the all-pervading interference of the State. The no-capitalist system implies the no-government system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 52<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While this essay will need a few articles for proper treatment, I will close with Kropotkin addressing opponents and those ignorant of his ideas of anarchism when they question him about morality in a society without a government:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8230;in the long run of the struggle for existence, &#8220;the fittest&#8221; will prove to be those who combine intellectual knowledge with the knowledge necessary for the production of wealth, and not those who are now the richest because they, or their ancestors, have been momentarily the strongest.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By showing that the &#8220;struggle for existence&#8221; must be conceived not merely in its restricted sense of a struggle between individuals for the means of subsistence but in its wider sense of adaptation of all individuals of the species to the best conditions for the survival of the species, as well as for the greatest possible sum of life and happiness for each and all, is has permitted us to deduce the laws of moral science from the social needs and habits of mankind. It has shown us the infinitesimal part played by positive law in moral evolution, and the immense part played by the natural growth of altruistic feelings which develop as soon as the conditions of life favor their growth. It has thus enforced the opinion of social reformers as to the necessity of modifying the conditions fo life for improving man, instead of trying to improve human nature by moral teachings while life works in an opposite direction. Finally, by studying human society from the biological point of view, it has come to the conclusions arrived at by anarchists from the study of history and present tendencies as to further progress being in the line of socialization of wealth and integrated labor combined with the fullest possible freedom of the individual.<\/p>\n<p>It has happened in the long run of ages that everything which permits men to increase their production, or even to continue it, has been appropriated by the few.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 53 <\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And finally, the injustice of our partition of wealth exercises the most deplorable effect on our morality. Our principles of morality say: &#8220;Love your neighbour as yourself&#8221;; but let a child follow this principle and take off his coat to give it to the shivering pauper, and his mother will tell him that he must never understand moral principles in their direct sense. If he lives according to them, he will go barefoot, without alleviating the misery around him! Morality is good on the lips, not in deeds. Our preachers say, &#8220;Who works, prays,&#8221; and everyone endeavors to make others work for him. They say, &#8220;Never lie!&#8221; and politics are a big lie. And we accustom ourselves and our children to live under this double-faced morality, which is hypocrisy, and to conciliate our double-facedness by sophistry. Hypocrisy and sophistry become the very basis of our life. But society cannot live under such a morality. It cannot last so: it must, it will, be changed.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 56<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Prince Peter Kropotkin&#8217;s &#8216;Spirit Of Revolt&#8217;, My Cyborg Fantasies, And Black Media Trust","content":"<p>I have been reading a few articles and academic papers that detail social media bots and their patterns. I ran across a line in one article that described Twitter accounts that are a hybrid of automation and human updating as &#8220;cyborg&#8221;. Now, as an adult who houses a younger self that once geeked out on Douglas Adams Dr. Who and such science fictions, this particular identification tickled me a bit. I probably fancied my Self more a mind reader of that Professor X lore than a cyborg, yet this reading did inspire me to consider those ways in which our forms of communication media extend our biological forms. This lead me to think of course about George Jackson&#8217;s thoughts on weapons as extensions of man, Marshall McCluhan, and without a doubt, Karl Marx. I also thought of some of history&#8217;s more influential pamphleteers such as Peter Kropotkin.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A collection of his pamphlets and articles turned into pamphlets during his life have been published in a book entitled and edited by Roger N. Baldwin,&#8221;Kropotkin&#8217;s Revolutionary Pamphlets: A Collection of Writings By Peter Kropotkin&#8221;. Contained within is an essay, &#8220;The Spirit Of Revolt&#8221;, in which is written:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are periods in the life of human society when revolution becomes an imperative necessity, when it proclaims itself as inevitable. New ideas germinate everywhere, seeking to force their way into the light, to find an application in life; everywhere they are opposed by the inertia of those whose interest it is to maintain the old order; they suffocate in the stifling atmosphere of prejudice and traditions. The accepted ideas of the constitution of the State, of the laws of social equilibrium, of the political and economic interrelations of citizens, can hold out no longer against the implacable criticism which is daily undermining them whenever occasion arises,&#8211;in drawing room as in cabaret, in the writings of philosophers as in daily conversation. Political, economic, and social institutions are crumbling; the social structure, having become uninhabitable is hindering, even preventing the development of the seeds which are being propagated within its damaged walls and being brought forth around them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;The morality of yesterday is today recognized as revolting immorality.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 35<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His writing is fairly poetic. Thankfully for its readers, it is a poetry of that better written variety. However, with poetry comes not only economy of words, but also romanticism. While Kropokin&#8217;s romanticism is less dainty, it being borne out of that bossom of a man in exile for much of his life, it does bear that lofty abstraction also known as &#8220;inspiration&#8221;. Although composed by an obviously read and intellectually trained person, it is also a writing that its writer understands must be consumed in short fashion. Yet, fluid, it is a writing that conjures images in an almost stacatto fashion. Yet, his insights are not reduced by his styling of them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His explicit highlighting of ideas as what drives dissatisfaction is a keen observation. As well as his treatment of moral obligations. There is an understanding here that society, as much of existence, is a dynamic state, and homeostasis is often a stagnant oppression where discomforts create potential chambers for combustion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In periods of frenzied haste toward wealth, of feverish speculation and of crisis, of the sudden downfall of great industries and the ephemeral expansion of other branches of production, of scandalous fortunes amassed in a few years and dissipated as quickly, it becomes evident that the economic institutions which control production and exchange are far from giving to society the prosperity which they are supposed to guarantee; they produce precisely the opposite result.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 36<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This passage above exposed for me much of that strength within Kropotkin&#8217;s composition. We are discussing a piece writting in 1880, that could easily be stated in regards to our present times. Whether this is a mark of those times&#8211; or a mark of ours&#8211; that his interpretation of his day&#8217;s economic structure in industrial Europe bear so much semblance to technocratic USA is brilliant. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Incapable of undertaking reforms, since this would mean paving the way for revolution, and at the same time too impotent to be frankly reactionary, the governing bodies apply themselves to half-measures which can satisfy nobody, and only cause new dissatisfaction. The mediocrities who, in such transition periods, undertake to steer the ship of State, think of but one thing: to enrich themselves against the coming <i>d\u00e9b?cle<\/i>. Attacked from all sides they defend themselves awkwardly, they evade, they commit blunder upon blunder, and they soon succeed in cutting the last rope of salvation; they drown the prestige of the government in ridicule, caused by their own incapacity. <\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 37<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here, I though Kropotkin&#8217;s almost complementary use of &#8220;reactionary&#8221; was noteworthy. In 2017, one typically does not find &#8220;reactionary&#8221; given honorable status, and yet, here we are. While, not to overlook his employment of characteristic, his ability to note that there is something of power in being reactionary as opposed to reformist. But, given that present state of Critical Theory that not only mutilates Marxism, but castrates it as well, this scale of power positions is refreshing, to say less than what might should be stated.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I suppose living in this age of Donald &#8216;The Don&#8217; Trump as US President, it would be remiss of me to not mention Kropotkin&#8217;s description of incompetence and ineptitude in office. His vision of maladroit statesperson&#8217;s at that helm of state authority solely to gather what is left of power is so reflective of my world in 2017, I chuckled against my other sentiments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a revolutionary situation arises in a country, before the spirit of revolt is sufficiently awakened in the masses to express itself in violent demonstrations in the streets or by rebellions and uprisings, it is through <i>action<\/i> that minorities succeed in awakening that feeling of independence and that spirit of audacity without which no revolution can come to a head.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In the midst fo discontent, talk, theoretical discussions, an individual or collective act of revolt supervenes, symbolizing the dominant aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Whoever has a slight knowledge of history and a fairly clear head knows perfectly well from the beginning that theoretical propaganda for revolution will necessiraly express itself in action long before the theoreticians have decided that the moment to act has come.

But the madmen win sympathy, the mass of the people secretly applaud their courage, and they find imitators. In proportion as the pioneers go to fill the jails and the penal colonies, others continue their work; acts of illegal protest, of revolt, of vengeance, multiply.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 39-40<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The direction which the revolution will take depends, no doubt, upon the sum total of the various circumstances that determine the coming of the cataclysm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>One party may have developed more clearly the theories which it defines and the program which it desires to realize; it may have made propaganda actively, by speech and in print.

As a result, this party is less known; its aspirations have not been daily and continuously affirmed by actions, the glamor of which could reach even the remotest hut; they have not sufficiently penetrated into the consciousness of the people; they have not identified themselves with the crowd and the street; they have never found simple expression in  a popular slogan.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most active writers of such a party are known by their readers as thinkers of great merit, but they have neither the reputation nor the capacities of men of action; and on the day when the mobs pour through the streets they will prefer to follow the advice of those who have less precise theoretical ideas and not such great aspirations, but whom they know better because they have seen them act.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 41-42<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is around these last two paragraphs that I begin to whip out my measuring stick of Black Media Trust and apply certain criticisms.

If I do not hear or read &#8220;doing the work&#8221; ever again in my breathing existence, it would still be stated too many times to not be annoying to me.

Once power is established by any group of malcontents, their agenda will be enforce their particular visions despite what visions might be held by others with their shared identities.

In it, he establishes an argument that much of our nation&#8217;s system of crime punishment was borne out of Rockefeller&#8217;s Drug Laws. Drug laws midwived by Black citizens concerned with growing heroin addicts, gang activity, drug peddlers, and criminality in their communities in general, he reasons.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his book&#8217;s introduction, he describes US Black leaders involvement with Rockefeller to establish these laws. This scene he illustrates takes place around 1973. I quote:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some were suspicious at the sight of African American leaders&#8211;civil rights activists and social reformers&#8211;promoting the patrician governor&#8217;s proposal to accelerate the imprisonment of young black males and expand a police state in Harlem. Black state senator Sidney Von Luther protested, &#8220;When he rounded up some ministers and other leaders to support him, he created a stacked deck; many of those people have gotten money from the Governor to run the very drug programs that have failed to solve the problem.&#8221; Woodrow Lewis, a black assemblyman from Brooklyn, lamented that Rockefeller had divided the black community by using these pastors as &#8220;[p]uppets and instruments in the creation of hysteria.&#8221; Lewis charged that the governor never consulted leaders who accurately reflected the desires of the city&#8217;s African American community. Even Joseph Persico, a Rockefeller aide and speechwriter, believed, at one point, that the governor had expertly manipulated some black ministers to engineer the passage of his drug program. In the proposal for his biography of Rockefeller, Persico wrote that the wily governor had called &#8220;in the chits&#8221; of Harlem pastors &#8220;whose churches had benefited from Rockefeller family bounty.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Black Silent Majority: The Rockefeller Drug Laws And The Politics Of Punishment&#8221;, Michael Javen Fortner, pg. 5<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am publicly one of those writers and thinkers that consider Black-on-Black crime a reality. That stated, I could not help but think of <a href=\"http:\/\/chicago.cbslocal.com\/2017\/02\/01\/donald-trump-ohio-pastor-chicago-gangs-violent-crime\/\" target=\"_blank\">US Black Trump supporters and their congregations claiming to have top gang thugs of Chicago&#8217;s ear<\/a>. Somethings never change, I suppose. Although, I do believe this scene painted for us here has a couple differing impetus. In today&#8217;s Mega Church, &#8220;Passing checks like Soros&#8221;, ambitious activist climate, it can be difficult to determine when an act is solely driven by profit motivations or from socio-political agenda. And as Fortner argues, it can at times be impossible in some minds to do one without doing that other.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Fortner also wishes to highlight is that timing of this policy change. According to his research, US Black leaders of that area had years of advocating for stronger laws and punishments for Blacks committing crimes, especially drug dealing, in Black communities. He notes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 1968, Roy Wilkins, the legendary leader of the NAACP, witnessed the toll crime was taking on African Americans and heralded the growing movement against it&#8230;By 1974&#8230;Roy Wood, a National Black Network radio commentator, urged a united effort in combating crime, saying,&#8221;I think when the criminal element of our communities becomes so bad and brazen that Black people are no longer safe on the streets&#8230;it is time to rally decent, self-respecting Black people together for nationwide action against Black on Black crime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In 1967, an African American business owner in Baltimore opined,&#8221;It&#8217;s been said that poverty is the cause [of crime], but many of us come from the ghetto, from poor homes and have not turned to crime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 8-9<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I can be conflicted in discussions such as these. Contradictions will abound. There is a line where I cannot possibly support laws that are excruciatingly biased and teleologically determined to socio-economically deprive US Blacks of social mobility. There is a side of me that will always be dedicated to a religion of &#8220;Phukkk Them Police&#8221;. Also, there is a side of me that locks all his doors at night as a defense mechanism for his wife and child not to be harmed by other US Blacks. There is a side of me that installs alarms in his house located in a predominantly Black Baltimore neighborhood. I do exist at an interesting intersection of disenfranchisement and upwardly mobile professional Black middle-class existence. I have to weigh every case differently. Including my own on some days.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fortner weaves his study around these two polar sets of US Black social being. In one camp he admits that he speaks and represents a silent minority of Middle and Working class Blacks that seldom are represented in discussions of this nature. He also does a lengthy job of explaining how USA maintains unjust strata of incarcerated US Blacks. Continuing his discussion in this vein, Fortner explicates:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A curious thing happened after the Civil Rights Movement ended. Many African Americans, who had just won new freedoms, found themselves captured once more after the 1970s. Numerous young black men were caught in the throes of the modern carceral state, a term used by scholars to describe the set of organizations and capacities employed by the government to administer its monopoly on violence and maintain order within its borders.<\/p>\n<p>First, mandatory-minimum drug sentences are the keystone of the modern carceral state: they allow for the policing and prosecution of relatively minor crimes and guarantee lengthy sentences for individuals convicted of these offenses, and both factors populate and propel the growth of prisons.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;New York&#8217;s Rockefeller drug laws, passed in 1973, represented a critical juncture in the historical development of the carceral state. They were the first of their kind, and, in the decade following their passage, forty-eight states enacted their own antidrug laws with mandatory-minimum sentences, instigating the rapid rise in the number of individuals imprisoned in state institutions before 1986.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 10-11<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fortner works diligently within these pages to address scholarship along this topic&#8217;s trajectory without becoming a fanboy for any particular set of hypotheses and analysis. He discusses Michelle Alexander&#8217;s &#8220;New Jim Crow&#8221; and without being caustic, he gently explains her shortcomings. He invites us to explore various interpretations of literature within this discourse.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Other accounts connect the rise of the carceral state to the ascendance of neoliberalism. The shift from the industrial society of the &#8220;Fordist-Keynesian order&#8221; to the &#8220;information society&#8221; of neoliberalism displaced American workers, particularly urban African Americans. A confluence of events closed off the labor market to the urban black poor: technological advances decreased the number of labor-intensive jobs, globalization replaced unionized labor in the United States with low-cost workers in other countries, and the information-based service-sector economy required higher educational levels and skills.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 13<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am not a fan of Fortner&#8217;s attempts to &#8220;tell it like it is&#8221;, I am pleased with his ability to frame US Black agency in a way that does not overlook structural accountability. He exemplifies this expertly in this following passage:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be clear, acknowledging black agency in a process does not mean assuming blacks had total control of its outcome. Instead, it means systematically studying the role that black politics played in the formation of crime policies. It also means deconstructing the very notion of &#8220;black interests&#8221; and allowing for the possibility of class conflict. Scholars have been slow to recognize forms fo black class conflict in the post-civil rights period. Michael C. Dawson, for instance, concedes the increasing significance of class in the life chances of African Americans but insists that &#8220;systematic manifestations of these class divisions in the political arena have been difficult to find.&#8221; Dawson offers the theory of &#8220;linked fate&#8221; to explain this paradox, arguing that, because middle-class African Americans and the black poor share a history of racial discrimination, the black middle-class relies on their racial identity rather than class status to understand their individual self-interests. &#8220;Linked fate,&#8221; however, ignores the fact that values operate as interpretative frames that individuals use to understand their material interests and their relationship and obligation to others. Within urban communities across the United States, working- and middle-class African Americans differentiate between &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221;, between &#8220;decent families&#8221; and &#8220;street families.&#8221; And &#8220;decent families&#8221; do not believe that their fate is linked with the fate of &#8220;street families.&#8221; In fact, they are committed to foregoing a future that they trust will be different from and brighter than the one &#8220;street families&#8221; will choose.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 14<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And probably vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sure, this phrase &#8220;street family&#8221; is a bit harsh. This entire dichotomy of &#8220;street family&#8221; versus &#8220;decent family&#8221; does not properly handle those many various mixtures of both. But it does present a well enough starting line. People with criminalized lifestyles have their own sets of values and principles. Often, when a conflict of interest presents itself among members of same race, racial solidarity lacks same cohesion as more immediate identifying factors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> I have to note here, intraracial conflicts in US Black communities, like intraracial conflicts in most other communities, are not simply along class lines. Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, New Orleans, and other various high profile Black areas are not seeped in blood because poor Blacks are shooting at upwardly mobile Blacks. Further, &#8220;upwardly mobile&#8221; might need more elaboration. A person selling drugs is also upwardly mobile, and they do not have to be &#8220;indecent&#8221; about their decorum. Even under definitions that might evolve under &#8220;whyte gaze&#8221;. Class alienation is often more specific in its exclusion, and factors like family, school pedigree, and social interests should be measured.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fortner does offer us his take on why his &#8220;Black middle class&#8221; tends to waiver along moral lines with regards to racial solidarity:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Black Silent Majority<\/i> argues that political aims of black middle-class morality vary according to the nature of threats to their social position. At the turn of the twentieth century, entrenched racism engendered the &#8220;politics of respectability,&#8221; which emphasized &#8220;reform of individual behavior and attitudes both as a goal in itself and as a strategy for reform of the entire structural system of American race relations.&#8221; Fearful of the &#8220;white gaze,&#8221; &#8220;righteous&#8221; middle-class African Americans sought to curtail behaviors among the poor that would perpetuate stereotypes and undercut middle-class claims of equality<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 15<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As stated, I think Fortner definitely paints a vivid image of events.

In one of his most notable books, &#8220;Propaganda: The Formation Of Men&#8217;s Attitudes&#8221;, he composes a chapter detailing what he believes are proper conditions for propaganda to grow. In this chapter entitled, &#8220;The Conditions For The Existence Of Propaganda,&#8221; he cites two major pillars for propaganda to thrive and live. Namely, he presents us with one, &#8220;The Sociological Conditions&#8221;, and two, &#8220;Objective Conditions Of Total Propaganda&#8221;. We will deal with that former set of conditions within his framework here.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Within Ellul&#8217;s two pillared organization of those conditions necessary for propaganda, he writes regarding those sociological conditions:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For propaganda to succeed, a society must first have two complementary qualities: it must be both an individualist and mass society. These two qualities are often considered contradictory. It is believed that an individualist society, in which the individual is thought to have a higher value than the group, tends to destroy groups that limit the individual&#8217;s range of action, whereas a mass society negates the individual and reduces him to a cipher&#8230;an individualist society <i>must<\/i> be a mass society, because the first move toward liberation of the individual is to break up the small groups that are an organic fact of the entire society.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>As soon as local organic groupings are reformed, society tends to cease being individualistic, and thereby to lose its mass character as well. What then occurs is the formation of organic groups of <i>elite<\/i> in what remains a mass society, but which rests on the framework of strongly structured and centralized political parties, unions, and so on. These organizations reach only an active minority, and the members of this minority cease to be individualistic by being integrated into such organic associations. From this perspective, individualistic society and mass society are two corollary aspects of the same reality. This corresponds to what we have said about the mass media: to perform a propagandistic function they must capture the individual and the mass at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Propaganda: The Formation Of Men&#8217;s Attitudes&#8221;, Jacques Ellul, pg. 90-91<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What I gathered here from Ellul&#8217;s is probably best articulated by use of a comparison. In identity politics, group identity is forged around what are defined as personal characteristics that are purportedly stigmatized and politicized at a group level. However, each identity as a political organ operates around a set of rules governing inclusion as well as hoisting up representative models as standard bearers. While our society is massive, it localizes not only in proximity but in group communication provided by mass media channels. Who we are is never as important as those groups that we claim to be represented by and affiliated with. In more specific, and possibly costly to me, terms: US Blacks hoist up individual success above group success and as an indicator of potential group success, while actually only being a very loosely associated group of individuals. It is easier to manipulate US Blacks to vote for a member of an elite class if that individual is seen as a representative of that group, not just an individual with personal interests and ambitions.  <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A group can hold an individual above that group&#8217;s interests if that group sees that individual also as giving that group some sort of representational value. LeBron James, while being only a basketball player, is hoisted as not only one of NBA&#8217;s greatest players but as a representational model of every citizen from Ohio. His success, while purely a consumer driving force in an entertainment market, is not seen in its sole profit motive lens, but in some gross savior\/messiah ontology. This erodes any local criticism of James even at that level of politics, a space James has absolutely no expertise in. His connection to local bodies of people that claim him as a representative is distant and fictive outside of personal nostalgia for one&#8217;s nativity. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ellul continues&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The society that favors the development of propaganda must be a society maintaining itself but at the same time taking on a new structure, that of the mass society&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>A mass society is a society with considerable population density in which local structures and organizations are weak, currents of opinion are strongly felt, men are grouped into large and influential collectives, the individual is part of these collectives, and a certain psychological unity exists. Mass society, moreover, is characterized by a certain uniformity of material life. Despite differences of environment, training, or situation, the men of a mass society have the same preoccupations, the same interest in technical matters, the same mythical beliefs, the same prejudices. The individuals making up the mass in the grip of propaganda may seem quite diversified, but they have enough in common for propaganda to act on them directly.<\/p>\n<p>In contemporary society there actually is a close relation between mass and crowd. Because a mass society exists, crowds can gather frequently &#8212; that is, the individual constantly moves from one crowd to another, from a street crowd to a factory crowd, or a theater crowd, a subway crowd, a crowd gathered at a meeting. Conversely, the very fact of belonging to crowds turns the individual more and more into a mass man and thus modifies his very being. There is no question that man&#8217;s psychic being is modified by his belonging to a mass society; this modification takes place even if no propaganda appeal is made to the soul of the crowd or the spirit of the collective.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Propaganda: The Formation Of Men&#8217;s Attitudes&#8221;, Jacques Ellul, pg 93-94<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This individual produced by a mass society is more readily available, more credulous, more suggestible, more excitable. Under such conditions propaganda can develop best.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Propaganda: The Formation Of Men&#8217;s Attitudes&#8221;, Jacques Ellul, pg. 94<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Before I dig into Ellul&#8217;s extremely pregnant statements there, I need to clarify his sexism. Whether a literary device, a convention of his times, or intentional hierarchy construction based on sexes there, it does cloud what is truly an attention worthy insight. However, I will take liberties here and interpret his singular use of &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;he&#8221; in this above passage as referring to members both sexes, and all those in between. That being written, I agree. Much of our failure to avoid group thought, or hive mind, is because how much our society is saturated in group dynamics even when we seek to absolve our thinking from conformity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Despite how it is worded, I value this insight that suggests there is an altering of our psychology under crowd and group based social objective conditions. Especially when I begin to apply it to my thoughts regarding US Black Media Trust. A framework that questions group obligations to individuals who are hoisted for exact same tendencies that caused that group&#8217;s oppression can only appreciate an examining of group pressure on individual mindsets.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"On Donald Bogle&#8217;s &#8220;Coons&#8221; And Black Media Trust","content":"<p>After reading a number of posts from US Blacks on various outlets using this term &#8220;coon&#8221; in a way that made me feel comfortable, I decided to revisit Donald Bogle&#8217;s &#8220;Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, &#038; Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks In American Films&#8221;. His opening chapter,&#8221;<i>Black Beginnings: from<\/i> Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin <i>to<\/i> The Birth of a Nation&#8221;, extends his now ubiquitously familiar framework. In it, he writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The pickaninny was the first of the coon types to make its screen debut&#8230;Thomas Alva Edison proved to be a pioneer in the exploitation and exploration of this type when he presented <i>Ten Pickaninnies<\/i> in 1904, a forerunner of the Hal Roach <i>Our Gang<\/i> series. During his camera experiments in 1893, Edison had photographed some blacks as &#8220;interesting side effects.&#8221; In <i>Ten Pickaninnies<\/i>, the side effects moved to the forefront of the action as a group of nameless Negro children romped and ran about while being referred to as snowballs, cherubs, coons, bad chillun, inky kids, smoky kids, black lambs, cute ebonies, and chubbie ebonies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In all the versions of <i>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin,<\/i> the slave child Topsy was presented as a lively pickaninny, used solely for comic relief.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg. 7<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The final member of the coon triumvirate is the uncle remus. Harmless and congenial, he is a first cousin to the tom, yet he distinguishes himself by his quaint, naive, and comic philosophizing. During the silent period he was only hinted at. He did not come into full flower until the 1930s and 1940s with films such as <i>The Green Pastures(1936)<\/i> and <i>Song of the South(1946)<\/i>. Remus&#8217;s mirth, like tom&#8217;s contentment and the coon&#8217;s antics, has always been used to indicate the black man&#8217;s satisfaction with the system and his place in it.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 8<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As far as the audiences were concerned, the toms, the coons, the mulattoes, the mammies, and the bucks embodied all the aspects and facets of the black experience itself. The audience&#8217;s deep-set prejudice against any &#8220;foreigners&#8221; accounts for the typing of all minorities in all American films. But no minority was so relentlessly or fiercely typed as the black man. Audiences rejected even subtle modifications of the black caricatures. When Jack Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion of the world in 1908, filmed sequences of him knocking out white Tommy Burns so disturbed the &#8220;racial pride&#8221; of white America that they were banned for fear of race riots. Thereafter, black boxers in films were invariably defeated by their white opponents. Similarly, when the first film versions of <i>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin<\/i> were released in the South, advertisements announced that the black characters were portrayed by white actors. Even at this stage the evolving film industry feared offending its dominant white audiences.<\/p>\n<p><cite>pg 17<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What I wanted to highlight in these two passages lightly removed from their chapter&#8217;s surrounding context is this notion of mythic types. Ultimately, Bogle is not just saying a particular behavior set performed by US Blacks is being a coon. He is fairly directly saying a particular set of behaviors was utilized by Whyte film makers to present US Blacks to US Whyte audiences in a particular way. Black actors that would eventually begin to be given roles in Whyte produced films would be typecast in these sorts of roles. These roles, these scripted characters, presented through media helped to continue to define patterns of US Black subordination to US Whytes. This is not a nod towards further intonations of US Black respectability politics from US Black bourgeois sectors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do not personally use this term &#8220;coon&#8221; in a loose, affectionate, or joking manner. How I see it being applied by one group of US Blacks to another group is blatant classism and elitism. It is another one of those reasons I have adopted my Black Media Trust framework for critical thinking.There is a line that has to be drawn when dealing with US Blacks as a group obligated to strangers based on outside oppressors in a land they are forced to call their own.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Dr. Torrance Stephen&#8217;s &#8220;Nobel Neocolonialism&#8221; &#038;&#038; Black Media Trust","content":"<p>As many pundits and political pretenders pander a false notion about US foreign policies prior to present president Donald Trump, I have been running my fingers through better analysis. In George Orwell&#8217;s 1984, a department of that main protagonist&#8217;s government is tasked with rewriting history for their media to represent to its people. When I was younger reading this story, I giggled in my naivet\u00e9. These days I simply hope for a continued determination and desire to rummage through tomes of well-documented history so that I might never forget what I a being told did not happen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of those books I have been revisiting is a collection of essays written by Dr. Torrance Stephens, &#8220;Nobel Neocolonialism: U.S. West Asian, North and East African Foreign Policy Under the Obama Administration&#8221;.

We take the approach of overthrowing an established government and then installing our own and call it nation building. The problem is that true nation building can only occur from the citizenry. We have created a monster, all these years, we have stood by and support tyrants who never supported democratic rule for our own purpose of a so-called peace with Israel or our war on the emotion we call terror.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Nobel Neocolonialism: U.S. West Asian, North and East African Foreign Policy Under the Obama Administration&#8221;, Torrance Stephens, pg 3<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> Dr. Torrance goes on to close this chapter with a discussion regarding &#8220;Islamic radicalism&#8221;. Along that same trajectory as these above-quoted paragraphs, he describes how USA under Obama furthered policies that created internecine conflicts throughout Middle Eastern nations. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What I highlight here mainly addresses several points I have repeated in my discourse I label, &#8220;Black Media Trust&#8221;. Dr. Torrance Stephens aptly describes USA&#8217;s strategy of modern imperialism(neocolonialism), as well as its practices of domestic propaganda. While I do not consider myself responsible for actions of Obama administration or USA military leaders, USA&#8217;s citizenry are often misled through a propaganda campaign that eases tensions with lofty terms that seldom represent objective reality accurately.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What Dr. Torrance Stephens accessibly articulates above is how US citizens, through media(mind you, this was written about Obama&#8217;s administration prior to all this hubbub about &#8220;fake news&#8221;) and academia, are persuaded to believe USA is extending &#8220;democracy&#8221; throughout a region whose instability was US manufactured. Whatever voices of those people is to be validated through group choice has to be weighed by factors exported to them by those in USA with enough power to find and exploit natural resources in that area. US government barely cares about maintaining peace and semblance of a democratic choice domestically without corporate gains. It would be a grave oversight in character judgment to think they care more about establishing a system of order outside their control and definition abroad.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"You Love Her Style ::: A Reading Of Richard Wright&#8217;s Reading Of Zora Neale Hurston","content":"<p>One danger of being a writer of criticism and critique of art is that my writing evolves into art itself. There is an aphorism I used to tout fairly regularly that states, <b><i>&#8220;Writing is a conversation, extended throughout time.&#8221;<\/i><\/b>. What I write about is not only another post in a thread, it is a sheet of metal, soldered onto a great ship, giving it further reinforcement to sail these great waters of existence.

So, it is always incumbent upon persons such as myself burdened with literary aspirations to be mindful of how large an audience based on a conversation extended throughout time can grow.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One example of such collisions of giants reverberating through eras is Richard Wright&#8217;s review of Zora Neale Hurston&#8217;s &#8220;Their Eyes Were Watching God&#8221;. In his article for <i>New Masses<\/i>, he stated:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> It is difficult to evaluate Waters Turpin&#8217;s These Low Grounds and Zora Neale Hurston&#8217;s Their Eyes Were Watching God. This is not because there is an esoteric meaning hidden or implied in either of the two novels; but rather because neither of the two novels has a basic idea or theme that lends itself to significant interpretation. Miss Hurston seems to have no desire whatever to move in the direction of serious fiction. . . .<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>New Masses 5 October 1937, Between Laughter and Tears, Richard Wright, pg 22-23<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It has to be stated here because often we as writers of critique and criticism forget our culpability when addressing our contemporaries. By most accounts, Zora died penniless and in destitution. I can easily argue that without Alice Walker&#8217;s resurrection spell, Zora&#8217;s work might still be in obscurity waiting for another sorceress to give her life again. Her children are grand testimonial to that one bit about pens and swords.Yes, by &#8220;children&#8221;, I mean her tales of Black life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Initial reads of Wright&#8217;s scathing assessment of Zora&#8217;s work left me wondering if it was solely a misogynistic stance. It may have been that case, I also would extend, especially in light of my own reading of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/pacific-papers\/carol-batkers-hurston-blues-women-class-us-black-womens-clubs-movement\/\" target=\"_black\">Carol Batker&#8217;s explanation of intraracial class antagonism leading to a set of treatments ultimately rendering Zora&#8217;s art invisible<\/a>, that there is a class-based element of scorn and psychological warfare here. Not only is it possible that Wright had no context with which to reasonably assess Zora, he also was disturbed that a woman associated with &#8220;low brow&#8221; renderings wrote it. His reading that her story had no direction, no purpose, and ultimately, no significance was not so much that her writing did not have those things. Only that he wishes his readers to believe they did not.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Just as a heads up, my reasoning is borne of rereadings of this particular paragraph from his review:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n Miss Hurston can write, but her prose is cloaked in that facile sensuality that has dogged Negro expression since the days of Phillis Wheatley. Her dialogue manages to catch the psychological movements of the Negro folk-mind in their pure simplicity, but that&#8217;s as far as it goes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Miss Hurston voluntarily continues in her novel the tradition which was forced upon the Negro in the theatre, that is, the minstrel technique that makes the &#8220;white folks&#8221; laugh. Her characters eat and laugh and cry and work and kill; they swing like a pendulum eternally in that safe and narrow orbit in which America likes to see the Negro live: between laughter and tears.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mind you, this is being penned by that same mind that brought us laughs and cries, killing and raping as trope and excuse, &#8220;Bigger Thomas&#8221;. I have that utmost respect for anyone that can pen novels, but let us be clear. We are discussing that guy that would go on to concoct that quintessential urban Black Male trope. &#8220;Bigger Thomas&#8221; is Donald Trump&#8217;s urban dweller, for christ&#8217;s sake! If Mr. Wright has trouble seeing direction, purpose, and what ultimately amounts to message and moral in Zora&#8217;s &#8220;Janie&#8221;, I have trouble seeing how while crafting his own &#8220;Bigger Thomas&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Being a poorer artist may have saved Zora from that great affliction of successful artists in academia. Namely, that need to appear more serious and be taken more gravely, than actually being something serious and worthy of urgent attention. I do not take for granted how easy it is to be swept away in romantic interpretations of times I did not live through. However, as I cordially add my post to this growing thread, I do hope it is understood that I clearly stand with Zora, and Mr. Wright is blinded by some projection or need to project for audience.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Carol Batker&#8217;s &#8220;Hurston&#8221;, Blues Women, Class, And US Black Women&#8217;s Clubs Movement","content":"<p>In &#8216;&#8221;Love me like I like to be&#8221;: The Sexual Politics of Hurston&#8217;s <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God<\/i>, the Classic Blues, and the Black Women&#8217;s Club Movement&#8217;, Professor Carol Batker discusses US Black Women&#8217;s Clubs as they directly relate to US Black Women of lower socio-economic strata.

However, <i>Their Eyes<\/i> does not reject charges of African American women&#8217;s libidinousness at the expense of sexual expression, as literary critics have argued of other texts from this period. Critics like Carby and Deborah McDowell have generally read African American women&#8217;s literature during the Harlem Renaissance as replicating the middle-class conservatism of club discourse and as opposing or suppressing the liberatory sexual discourse of the blues.

However, what this work misses in its attempt at that liberal academic flaw of too much rhetoric, not enough observation, is that those two groups where oppositional based on class. Sure, they shared common contradictions in public speech, writings, performances, and songs. So, Los Angeles&#8217;s Bloods and Crips, it does not make their violent choice of conflict resolution more hopeful. Those contradictions they share, those complexity of both groups, are for most part, non-sequitur.

There is a chapter in this fairly exhaustive text entitled,'&#8221;To Be a Woman, Sublime&#8221;: The Ideas of the National Black Women&#8217;s Club Movement (to 1917)&#8221; that I turned my attention to. While I truly plan on providing my analysis of this entire chapter, and hopefully this entire book, there are a few passages early on in it that I wish to parse in this writing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As I covered in my reading of Lang&#8217;s book, there was always a class-based component of not only US Black Women&#8217;s work, but Women&#8217;s work in large. Here Paula Giddings explains throughout this chapter various battles fought by Black Women&#8217;s Clubs, including their departure from a wider feminism due to Whyte Women embracing racist postures, as well as addressing historic appeals made by Black Women to Black men that sought to employ those same stereotypes of US Black Women as espoused by their Whyte counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In her own words from her extensive research, Paula Giddings writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Black women&#8217;s club movement did have a number of things in common with the White club movement that preceded it. In some ways, as Fannie Barrier Williams noted, Black women were indeed inspired by the success of the White movement. The two groups were organized in much the same way; the General Federation of Women&#8217;s Clubs was the White equivalent to the NACW; the membership of both organizations consisted mostly of middle-class educated women who were steeped in the Protestant ethic. Neither group questioned the superiority of middle-class values or way of life, or had any romantic notions of the inherent nobility of the poor, uneducated masses; education and material progress were values that Black and White women shared.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;When And Where I Enter: The Impact Of Black Women On Race And Sex In America&#8221;, Paula Giddings, pg 94<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the earliest White women&#8217;s clubs was founded in response to the exclusion of women journalists from the New York Press Club in 1868. After helping to organize a dinner honoring Charles Dickens, the women were put out when they were denied tickets to attend the affair. The consequent founding of the Sorosis Women&#8217;s Club set a general pattern for these organizations. They were created by women who were frustrated by their exclusion from occupations and other activities for which their education and background had prepared them. They had little concern for women who were forced to work, with the exception of &#8220;the middle-class spinster, widow, or woman whose marriage had failed, or was doing teaching, doing office work, or in some instances training herself for a profession,&#8221; as a feminist historian noted.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It was not that these groups entirely ignored the plight of the poor. There were salutary efforts toward improving living and working conditions for the less fortunate. However those efforts were often motivated by upper-class frustration. For women, helping the poor was one of the few socially sanctioned activities that could be performed outside the home.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;When And Where I Enter: The Impact Of Black Women On Race And Sex In America&#8221;, Paula Giddings, pg 97<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Continuing along to describe this ideological base of Black Women&#8217;s Clubs, she writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The philosophy of the clubwomen concerning motherhood reflected the new realities they faced in the late nineteenth century. In the 1830&#8217;s, Maria Stewart told Black mothers it was their duty to &#8220;cultivate a pure heart&#8221; and the &#8220;thirst for knowledge&#8221; in their children. By nurturing these noble qualities, Stewart believed, &#8220;the hissing and reproach&#8221; toward the race would cease. More than half a century later, Black women leaders believed that those same qualities were to be taught so that children could <i>endure<\/i> that inevitable reproach. &#8220;We believe,&#8221; said Terrell, &#8220;we can build the foundation of the next generation upon such a rock of morality, intelligence and strength, that the floods of proscription, prejudice and persecution may descend upon it in torrents and yet it will not be moved.&#8221; Josephine Bruce supported that view: &#8220;The Negro home,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is rapidly assuming the position designated for it. It is distinctly becoming the center of social and intellectual life; it is building up strength and righteousness in its sons and daughters, and equipping them for the inevitable battles of life which grow out of the struggle for existence.&#8221; For these Black women the home was not so much a refuge from the outside world as a bulwark to secure one&#8217;s passage through it.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;When And Where I Enter: The Impact Of Black Women On Race And Sex In America&#8221;, Paula Giddings, pg 99-100<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My initial sitting with Paula Giddings&#8217;s work was about five years ago. At that time, I was totally unfamiliar with National Association of Women&#8217;s work. An introduction of their work, their influence on feminism, and more importantly, their strategies of organizing across these United States, culminating into what would be referred to as those &#8220;Black Women&#8217;s Clubs Movement&#8221;. While this history is indeed rewarding, I do feel as though there is a leniency in presenting Black Women&#8217;s Clubs&#8217;s membership motives in comparison to those of their Whyte counterparts.  It would seem to me that based on even just these quotes above, that many of those US Black Women involved with these organizing efforts had extremely bourgeois notions of Negro uplift.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is one of those times where I want to make sure of my intentions with Asylum.

It has to be understood that although I do find it bias for Paula Giddings to frame this membership&#8217;s relations to lower class US Black Women as anything more noble than elitist liberal patronizing and paternalism, these luminaries do have my utmost respect. I just question their ideals and visions of Black progress because they are socialized to define using standards more capable of forming slave masters than slave rebellions or slave escapes.

This would implore me to qualify him as historian. His book of history details relationships between various class factors in St. Louis, Missouri as it relates to protest, uprisings, and strikes in and around my nativity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Often enough, race in these United States is presented in such a way that it &#8220;flattens&#8221; our social strata. Race is discussed as if class does not exist, or as if class does not influence race like a pack of Kool Aid poured into a pitcher of water influences how we would perceive that water. Class not only &#8220;colors&#8221; race, it redefines our parameters. Lang does a fabulous job unearthing historic social collisions that shaped my hometown&#8217;s socio-political texture.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In his first chapter, &#8220;&#8221;, he discusses various local cliques, groups, and organizations whose members helped carve that texture into St. Louis&#8217;s social landscape. One group that he discusses that piqued my interest was what is referred to as those Black Women&#8217;s Clubs. Now, St. Louis was not that only city to have a preponderance of actively organized Black Women, in fact, US Black Women&#8217;s Clubs was a national trend during those times. However, St. Louis did have its own specific history that might helps to understand not only St. Louis&#8217;s brand of US Black Women&#8217;s Clubs, but also those existing nationally.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On that topic, he writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Black clubwomen, many of whom were modestly paid teachers or wage workers, measured their status by &#8220;ladyhood,&#8221; as demonstrated in personal appearance, comportment, and &#8220;moral virtue,&#8221; and conspicuous adherence to patriarchal family norms. Ironically, behind many &#8220;successful&#8221; black businessmen, doctors, or attorneys were the wage-earning wives who actually supported them. Yet, cleaving to prevalent ideals of bourgeois respectability, black women might completely obscure their waged identities, identifying themselves instead by civic associations, the physical maintenance of their households, or some combination thereof. The Elleardsville Social Settlement Club, which sponsored public lectures on hygiene and child-rearing, asserted a place ofr &#8220;the better sort&#8221; of women in domestic management. Homeownership was a trait that particularly distinguished the Ville&#8217;s symbolic elite from the laboring majority who rented housing in the ramshackle Central Corridor. The one- and two-story homes in the Ville were often small brick cottages nestled among unpaved, tree-lined streets. Still, residents took active pride in these single-family dwellings, with the Elleardsville Civic League awarding prizes for the best-kept yard.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Grassroots At The Gateway&#8221;, Clarence Lang, pg 21<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He also discusses another group of US Black Women from St. Louis whose class designations and political associations might bar them from membership in those same US Black Women&#8217;s Club. He writes:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The emphasis on industrial strongmen in Communist iconography not only implicitly devalued black women&#8217;s particular issues around work and living conditions, but it also ignored their involvement in the presumabl masculine arena of street battles&#8211;as in the case of the black women whose charge at the doors of City Hall had ignited the July skirmish. It also ignored their pivotal role in the imagined male preserve of union organizing. Drawn to the council&#8217;s neighborhood-level mobilizations, where they came into contact with radical labor organizers, black women became especially active in renewed unionization drives. Indeed, the most significant black Communist-oriented labor insurgency in St. Louis was &#8220;manned&#8221; not by thick muscled, square-jawed heroes idealized in proletarian art and literature, but rather by black women employed in the marginal sweatshops of the city&#8217;s food-processing industry.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Grassroots At The Gateway&#8221;, Clarence Lang, pg 29<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Lang continues further in his book to describe how these US Black Women laboring in R.

And where it does not, it may be reasonable to question whatever conservative strands of thought have caused changing dynamics to retard.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In Anna Julia Cooper&#8217;s A Voice From The South, there is a patriotic sentiment that reminds me of my own times. In her first chapter, &#8220;Womanhood A Vital Element In The Regeneration And Progress Of A Race&#8221;, she discusses treatment of Women by various patriarchies. She speaks of what she refers to in this writing as &#8220;Oriental countries&#8221;(in her words this includes those of China and Islamic nations such as Turkey) as well as Europe and United States of America. She does not mention in these earlier pages any nations of Africa. Her thoughts of Europe and America(USA) are affectionate, they seem to find more in common with propaganda than intellectual rigor. Of course, academic USA has always had its profit motivations sacrificing its more noble potential for propaganda or even more grossly, marketing. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Let me sprinkle some quotes so that I am not mistaken for putting words in her writing.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Cooper states:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Happiness,&#8221; says Madame de Stael, &#8220;consists not in perfections attained, but in a sense of progress, the result of our own endeavor under conspiring circumstances <i>toward<\/i> a goal which continually advances and broadens and deepens till it is swallowed up in the Infinite.&#8221; Such conditions in embryo are all that we claim for the land of the West. We have not yet reached our ideal in American civilization. The pessimists even declare that we are not marching in that direction.

This was composed in 1886. We are discussing a scholar who only knows 31 years of US existence without US Black forced southern subordination prior to those national hostilities of 1910s and 1920s. Her only understanding of US as an embryo is while US Blacks are slaves and discriminated against in every position in lieu of wealth and pedigree.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>She continues this line of thought with:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Respect for woman, the much lauded chivalry of the Middle Ages, meant what I fear it still means to some men in our own day&#8211;respect for the elect few among whom they expect to consort.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The idea of the radical amelioration of womankind, reverence for woman as woman regardless of rank, wealth, or culture, was to come from that rich and bounteous fountain from which flow all our liberal and universal ideas&#8211;the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 14<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Cooper&#8217;s is a dangerous analysis that attempts to frame one set of oppressions as better than another without considering whatever benefits each influence on that other. Islam nor Christianity lives historically in a vacuum unfiltered by that other set of beliefs. Islam is not limited to that Arabian Peninsula any more than Christianity was limited to Constantine&#8217;s reign. As &#8220;Mahomet&#8221; is inspired by stories visited upon of Jesus to speak into Quran an entire surah(chapter) devoted to Mary(not to mention another entire surah translated,&#8221;The Women&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I do, however, want to applaud her feminism. While limited to a late 1800s Black Church interpretation of Christianity, there is a criticism I want to be associated with Black Media Trust. She does question purpose of male praise of Women at a cultural(systematic) level where it reinforces systemic oppressions of Women. This is something she does often throughout this piece that I simply adore her for.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, my concern with her religiosity here is its lack of research and appreciation for other religions solely because they are not Whyte European religions. This writing is read by Ms. Cooper in front of a &#8220;convocation of colored clergy of the Protestant Episcopal Church at Washington, D.C.&#8221; according to a footnote. David Walker&#8217;s Appeal is also written as from a heavily religious centered perspective. I am reminded of when Dr. John Henrik Clarke in &#8220;Who Betrayed The African World Revolution?&#8221; discusses not being able to discuss socialism in anti-religious terms with Black Church goers. If I am being harsh here, it is not because of Ms. Cooper&#8217;s religious tone, it is because her tone is dripping with Whyte Supremacist notions hidden by a group think centered processing of religion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This chapter, once again, is addressing Washington D.C. clergy at that end of 19th Century USA.

American journalism is often misleading, myopic, and unreliable when it comes to detailing the lives of African-Americans.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Don&#8217;t Believe The Hype: Fighting Cultural Misinformation About African-Americans&#8221;, Farai Chideya, pg 3<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>First printing of this book is documented as February 1995. Given that, it can be assumed that many damn statistics contained within it will be inaccurate in 2017 when I am writing this. However, Farai gives us a set of guidelines that work as principles much like how I discuss Black Media Trust.<\/p>\n<p>In her first chapter, she outlines in a very accessible manner five ideas that should sit somewhere near our frontal cortex when parsing media depictions of US Blacks. Entitled,&#8221;When Is A Fact Not The Truth?&#8221;, she prefaces this list with a precise definition of how she uses this term &#8220;media&#8221;:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the media, anyway? &#8230; &#8220;media&#8221; doesn&#8217;t just mean newspapers, magazines, and the television news. Advertisements, television shows, and politicians&#8217; statements are equally powerful ways that Americans learn facts&#8211;and stereotypes&#8211;about African-Americans.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 6<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I would also add religious texts, video games, music, and a litany of other screen-based mass communication mediums that did not exist when Farai was writing this. That aside, I think her abstraction here is necessary and healthy. I call it necessary and healthy because too often I discuss media with individuals who have a very limited scope of what can be included under that label. It helps to understand that what influences us&#8211; and many others&#8211; is more than just a small set of mediums. If it can communicate, it can influence someone. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Farai proceeds to list her 5 principles of Black Media Trust:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Top Five Reasons Why The Perception Does Not Equal The Reality<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Journalism is one of the most segregated professions in America.<\/li>\n<p>In the broadcast industry, only six percent of management jobs are held by African-Americans.<\/p>\n<li>Journalists and others in the media are human&#8211;they work from what they know<\/li>\n<p>When it comes to doing &#8220;real people&#8221; articles&#8211;like a photo essay on a day in the park or a story on buying a new car&#8211;many reporters go to communities that they are familiar with.<\/p>\n<li>It&#8217;s easy to get stories from the ghetto.<\/li>\n<p>The adage goes, &#8220;If it bleeds, it leads.&#8221; When it comes to stories of deviance and degradation, white reporters go more easily to black neighborhoods because, among other reasons, they aren&#8217;t likely to feel personally conflicted about the people they&#8217;re portraying in a negative light. Although the vast majority of drug users are white, it&#8217;s easier to focus on inner-city crack use than it is to examine middle-class cocaine and heroin addicts.<\/p>\n<li>White journalists are presumed to be objective; black journalists, quite often, are presumed not to be objective about racial issues.<\/li>\n<p>Therefore white journalists often have more latitude to freely express their views on race.<\/p>\n<li>Once something becomes &#8220;conventional wisdom,&#8221; even if it&#8217;s misleading, it gets repeated over and over again.<\/li>\n<p>Language can also become &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221;. Words like &#8220;gang&#8221; are consistently used to describe group of young Black men&#8211;even when they have absolutely no gang affiliation.<\/p>\n<\/ol>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 6-9<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once again, similar to how exploding a concept like &#8220;media&#8221; to a more wider application, viewing &#8220;words&#8221; as conduits of myth is beneficial. Ultimately, there is a need to realize that those who tell us our &#8220;truths&#8221; are just people telling us something. This &#8220;something&#8221; needs to be weighed by same criteria we would use to measure credibility of a local gossip or someone known to talk about others a lot. There is a danger when we invest authority into personalities simply due to institutions they are attached to, pedigree, or simply because they have what Adolph Reed, Jr calls a &#8220;televisual presence&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Farai addresses this last concern when she closes this chapter with:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Media outlets are supposed to be authorities, so in order to question their judgment, critics have to gather authoritative facts&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Can something be a fact and still not be true? When &#8220;truth&#8221; means giving a clear picture of a situation, what seem like solid statistics and hard numbers can often be interpreted to give totally different impressions.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 9<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Facts, like numbers, may not have an ability to communicate, but those communicating with them can interpret them in ways that can be misleading.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Mumia &#038; Angela Davis On Abolition Democracy And Community Courts","content":"<p>&#8220;Alternatives To The Present System Of Capitalist Injustice&#8221; is edited and compiled by Frances Goldin, Debby Smith, and Michael Steven Smith.

Greenberg wrote. Herman and Julia Schwendinger, he noted, &#8220;argued that to restrict research to violations of state-made law is to accept the definitions of harm and wrongfulness that the state asserts, and they urge their coworkers to redefine crime as a violation of human rights. These definitions are based on the conceptions of harm held by those who have the power to make law, and consequently, tend to exclude from scrutiny harms caused by the actions of the upper class.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Alternatives To The Present System Of Capitalist Injustice&#8221;, Mumia Abu-Jamal &#038; Angela Davis, essay found in &#8220;Alternatives To The Present System Of Capitalist Injustice&#8221; pg. 60<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>States do not exist in a similar fashion to trees, cats, or even entire solar systems. That organic element of state organization is purely social interaction. Those social interactions are between humans. These humans tend to have personal definitions of harm centered around their enhanced positions of power. This quote from Herman and Julia Schwendinger could lend itself to narrow definitions of &#8220;human rights&#8221;. However, it could also be used to further indict powerful groups that hold sway over &#8220;justice departments&#8221; that violate human rights as they sanction state criminals. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mumia and Angela continue their discussion as they write:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social structures&#8211;courts, police, prisons, and so on&#8211;have within them a deep bias about what constitutes crime and what does not. Any social structure is a product of its previous historical, economic, and social iterations, and these previous forms significantly influence later forms. The present system, in addition to being increasingly repressive, is the logical inheritance of its racist, hierarchical, exploitative past&#8211;a reactive formation to attempts to transform, democratize, and socialize it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For authentic democracy to emerge, &#8220;abolition democracy&#8221; must be enacted&#8211;the abolition of institutions that advance the dominance of any group over any other&#8230;As long as the prison-industrial complex remains, American democracy will continue to be a false one. Such a false democracy reduces people and their communities to the barest biological subsistence because it pushes them outside the law and the polity.<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;Alternatives To The Present System Of Capitalist Injustice&#8221;, Mumia Abu-Jamal &#038; Angela Davis, essay found in &#8220;Alternatives To The Present System Of Capitalist Injustice&#8221; pg. 61<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another set of brilliant points here. There is a deafening demand in this land for a nuanced understanding of democracy. This demand existed decades prior to George Bush or Donald Trump providing US citizens with a first-hand education in US Civics vis-a-vis this US electoral college. Democracy as an ideal is quickly confused for spectacle politics in this bipartisan forced selection of one of two evils from local elections to federal ones. This use of a lofty label, namely &#8220;democracy&#8221;, limits our ability to actually implement it. &#8220;Abolition democracy&#8221; as these two giants suggest, is sorely overdue. Abolish what exists presently. It exists due to what existed in this nation&#8217;s past. A fair and just system cannot define what is a criminal act if it is simply rich criminals with power to create more &#8220;criminals&#8221; of lower class strata.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mumia and Angela extend their argument by stating:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What sociologist Loic Wacquant has termed the &#8220;penal state&#8221; is driving the profound social inequality and unparalleled repression that is the prison-industrial complex. Economic, political, and social forces have converged to create a system of vested interests to ensure its continued expansion and wealth.<\/p>\n<p>In sum, the present system drains public resources to pursue a chimera of public safety when it is actually a legalized system of violence against unprivileged communities, who have been the historical bogeymen of the American body politic.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 62<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The US federal system&#8211;a kind of dual sovereignty&#8211;owes much to the Iroquois Confederacy, or the Six Nations Confederacy, which compromised the Mohawks, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora nations. The confederacy lasted for several centuries despite enormous pressure from the Anglo-Americans&#8230;Among the Native Americans of the Northeast, criminal justice was a communal concern.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 64<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>They state further:<\/p>\n<p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Establishing community courts (especially ones composed of non-lawyers) would utilize these insights from traditional societies and thus mitigate the destructiveness inherent in the present corporate-type, assembly-line system that is breaking state budgets and individuals&#8217; bodies and spirits on the anvil of so-called criminal justice.<\/p>\n<p>Nor is this idea unthinkable within the current US legal system. In Pennsylvania, both the state constitution and state law provide for the establishment of &#8220;community courts&#8221; as a section of what&#8217;s termed the minor judiciary. One was opened in Philadelphia in 2002, becoming one of approximately thirty community courts in US cities (and fifty outside of the United States). Like its counterparts, the Philadelphia Community Court was empowered to use community service and other restorative sanctions to address &#8220;quality of life&#8221; offenses such as prostitution, drug possession, and theft.<\/p>\n<p><cite>ibid., pg 66<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These paragraphs present their core suggestion as solution and part conclusion. This suggestion of &#8220;community courts&#8221; is not only an offered solution, but also a subtle face grab positioning our eyes on this system&#8217;s most pernicious concern: it is typically top-down, one-sided, and while sold as &#8216;of the people&#8217;, it is far from that. Juries composed of our &#8220;peers&#8221; are seldom fused in a way that suggests &#8220;a body of people sharing a common perspective with defendants and plaintiffs capable of understanding objective conditions that lead to particular decisions&#8221;.<\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"Elaine Brown, Technopoly, and Huey&#8217;s Analysis Of Reactionary Intercommunalism","content":"<p>I do not believe one religion, ideology, or set of talking points is ever an accurate description of human social existence.

It was opened to an advertisement.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an ad for Ford cars&#8221; was all I could say.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, but what does it <i>say?<\/i> Look!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He was pacing with excitement as I read the copy aloud: &#8220;We at Ford International fly the American flag&#8230;'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;But we say,'&#8221; he repeated with me, fired with enthusiasm, &#8220;&#8216;we say, what flag do <i>you<\/i> fly?&#8217;&#8230;It&#8217;s incredible, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; I responded, opening the door through which he was anxious to pass.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Before I tell you, do you recall the Coca-Cola jingle: &#8216;I&#8217;d love to buy the world a Coke&#8230;&#8217;? That. Remember?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, with all those wonderful, perfect-looking, Americanized Africans and Asians and&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Exactly&#8230;But the bottom line is: they&#8217;d love to <i>sell<\/i> the world a Coke&#8230;&#8217;We at Ford say what flag to <i>you<\/i> fly.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What does it mean? &#8230;It means that the U.S. capitalists have taken a turn, a right turn. And I think it&#8217;s affecting the economic structure of the entire world. We&#8217;re in a brand-new game.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m right, we can&#8217;t define the world anymore as a collection of sovereign states with independent economies. What this bit of advertising bullshit triggered in my mind is that a new economic arrangement has taken hold, one that exists irrespective of language, custom, ideology, flags, and, most of all, <i>territory<\/i>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;First, you have to accept that a human being&#8217;s life in society is determined by his relationship to its economy. Before industrialization, that relationship everywhere was to a land-based, agricultural economy. Generally speaking, if one had land, one was rich; if not, one was poor. A brutal but long-standing social arrangement.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Industrialization disrupted that. It introduced mass production, new transportation methods, powerful infrastructures. It transformed the structure of society because it spurred the rise of capitalism, which killed the feudal landlord by opening the doors of wealth to a new class: the bourgeoisie. Wealth came to be determined not by landholding but by industrial-based profit.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of the people in the countries that became industrialized, however, only left oppression in the field for oppression in the factory. Of course, none of that meant anything to people in the nonindustrialized countries.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This shift was conmpleted by the end of the last century. But I think the change was only quantitative. Because the social structures under both feudalism and capitalism were rooted in national economies. Now I think a shift has occurred that is more profound than the transformation from feudalism to capitalism&#8211;a <i>qualitative<\/i> shift. Modern technology has introduced a <i>global<\/i> economic structure that has wiped out capitalism&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always accepted the Marxist analysis that our oppression was grounded in the rise of capitalism. For blacks here, of course, going from the post-Civil War fields to the industrial centers didn&#8217;t put many of us into the industrial proletariat. Racism precluded that. But that&#8217;s our class relationship in the U.S., and defines our present, postagrarian enslavement. So we concluded that socialist revolution was the road to our freedom. I don&#8217;t believe that means anything anymore, if a <i>global<\/i> economic arrangement has succeeded in overwhelming capitalism.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;After the Russians sent up Sputnik, the U.S. poured every dollar it had into technological exploration in space and other military adventures&#8211;notably by diverting billions of dollars from resolving the internal social ills U.S. capitalism had created. The government and the capitalists built what Eisenhower called the &#8216;military-industrial complex.&#8217; As U.S. technology mushroomed. And the U.S. became, in fact, the most militarily powerful country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The U.S. capitalists found their production capacity becoming manifold and unlimited. Up until then, they had followed the line of the other imperialist nations. To increase profits, they had to rip off raw materials and free or cheap labor from the darker continents. But the technological advances reduced the need for both labor and raw materials. The problem is, you can&#8217;t sell shit if you don&#8217;t have people with salaries to buy it. If they can produce more than the U.S. market can bear, they&#8217;ve reached the limits of profitability. They need to develop new <i>marketplaces<\/i>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The American way of life&#8211;capitalism&#8211;is no longer threatened by Communism. Soviet inroads into the undeveloped Third World are irrelevant. The U.S. capitalists are threatened by a limitation of marketplaces. They not only <i>need<\/i> to sell the whole world a Coke, they&#8217;re moving to do it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Consider Vietnam. I think the war has very little to do with Vietnam&#8217;s tungsten and bauxite. Technology will soon be able to accommodate the need for those raw materials without Vietnam&#8211;like the industrial diamonds that can be synthesized; or the way coal was replaced by oil production, due to technological development. And they don&#8217;t need the unskilled labor. They need the marketplace! I think Vietnam is about developing a marketplace of forty million potential consumers. It&#8217;s a play-or-pay proposition: they <i>will<\/i> buy a Coke.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The rest of the world is just trying to keep up or survive. Take the communities in Africa and South America, with their vast copper and diamond deposits&#8211;discounting what hasn&#8217;t already been stolen. The people can&#8217;t eat these precious materials. And the territorial governments, neocolonialists, and local bourgeoisie don&#8217;t have the technology to transform them into food and other basic necessities. But even if they could refine the raw materials and get around the massive distribution problems, they would be hard put to compete with U.S.-established price formulas and rates of exchange. And if they found their way around that, they&#8217;d find themselves facing the hard line of U.S. market competition: the U.S. military machine. And they won&#8217;t get around that. The point is, technology has produced domination of the entire world by one nation: the United States of America.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Assuming this analysis is basically correct, there&#8217;s a new socioeconomic arrangement that is not bound by national territory&#8230;We cannot, then, continue to use the term &#8216;capitalism&#8217; or &#8216;imperialism&#8217; to define the structure that governs and oppresses us. A new language is required for this new arrangement. I&#8217;m calling it &#8216;reactionary intercommunalism.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I use this term because the new arrangement has not only overwhelmed capitalism, it has obliterated nationhood. If we use Stalin&#8217;s definition, a nation is, primarily, a sovereign territory with economic and social independence. I believe U.S. global power has transformed things so that the world&#8217;s nations have been reduced to a collection of integrated <i>communities<\/i>. What you have now dominating all the communities of the new world economic order is a global bourgeoisie: the owners of the U.S. corporate conglomerates, the reactionary intercommunalists&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What is the functional difference in the relationship to the U.S. economy of Africans living in Africa and Africans living Harlem? Or take Vietnam again. The U.S. refers to its war on the Vietnamese as a &#8216;police action&#8217; &#8212; and it basically is: no different in kind from putting down a riot in Watts&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The reactionary intercommunalists have obliterated national independence and sovereignty. Of course, there are some liberated territories, like Russia and China. At best, they are what I would call &#8216;provisional revolutionary administrations,&#8217; but not independent, sovereign nations &#8212; not in the global shadow of the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;re the Europeans. Can the French or the British, two of the leading European economies, legitimately lay claim to economic independence and national sovereignty when even the old international gold standard has become the U.S. dollar standard?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why Ford can ask what flag do you fly. It&#8217;s not important. When they control your market, they&#8217;ll have the rest. If you want to be &#8216;black and proud,&#8217; they put Negroes in advertising campaigns and have all the Negroes fighting for the right to drink Coke over Pepsi. For the Chinese they throw up Bank of America buildings that look like pagodas. And if you fly a flag with a hammer and sickle, they&#8217;ll slap it on the dashboard of a Ford and control the Communist communities &#8212; that the Communists themselves can&#8217;t accommodate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><cite>&#8220;A Taste Of Power: A Black Woman&#8217;s Story&#8221;, Elaine Brown, pg 277-280<\/cite><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"&#8220;In The Shadow Of Brown&#8221; ::: Mumia Abu-Jamal &#038; Brown Vs.

Fields and Barbara J. Fields explore racial classification in historic and popular discussion. While this is most definitely a noble argument, their main motivation is defense of 44th President Barrack Obama&#8217;s lineage. As a collection of essays presenting race as a social construct primarily used to force people to live according to a pecking order, this work is brilliant. As a bullet proof vest for a guy that referred to his own Self as a mutt racially, and consistently demeaned US Blacks as &#8220;thugs&#8221; who needed to pull their pants up and take care of their children, it reeks of celebrity worship. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Their book&#8217;s first chapter, &#8220;A Tour Of Racecraft&#8221;, states:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\nSumptuary codes enforce social classification. They consist of rules, written or unwritten, that establish unequal rank and make it immediately visible. When there is no phenotypic difference&#8230;sumptuary rules do what nature leaves undone&#8230;Sumptuary rules in slaveholding America reserved certain fabrics for slaves and might forbid certain colors. In that spirit, a group of Charlestonians demanded legislation to &#8220;prevent the slaves from wearing silks, satins, crapes, lace muslins, and such costly stuffs as are looked upon and considered the luxury of dress,&#8221; because &#8220;every distinction should be created between the whites and the negroes, calculated to make the latter feel the superiority of the former.&#8221;<br \/>\n<cite>&#8220;Racecraft: The Soul Of Inequality In American Life&#8221;, Karen E.

One of those myriad of reasons I address a need for Black Media Trust is a use of media messages that suggest how US society is ordered. We refer to this in other terms as hegemony. What I disagree with these sisters on is their use of this discussion of &#8220;sumptuary rules&#8221; to protect a man whose entire body of politics is obedience and acquiescence to social orders. Ironically, in their own book, these brilliant women write:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Obedience usually concealed the intrinsic violence of the rule and kept black people visibly in their place.<br \/>\n<cite>&#8220;Racecraft: The Soul Of Inequality In American Life&#8221;, Karen E.

In many forms similar to religion, it would seem that we hold onto race despite its contradictions due to its power of belonging and makeshift identity. Race is a cheat code for intimate belonging and in-depth individual style development.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As stated by Dr. Reed, Jr, in our attempt to legitimize these group categorization, we employ terms like ethnicity. But this verbal recruitment only reveals our insecurity: a reflection of our collective position along a social spectrum. It is an acceptance that an unfilled hole has been dug in our psychological body. Our retreat into myths necessary for immediate social cohesion demands we seek to justify those myths with rationalizations. <\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"},{"title":"George Jackson On Authority, Social Order, And Public Intellectuals","content":"<blockquote>\n<p>Enough time has passed now since the emergence of fascism, the extreme crisis that precipitated it, and the hostilities that caused its early development to view it with less of the coloring that sensationalism and war propaganda necessarily create. We should now be able, after time has somewhat dulled the traumatic exchanges of debate and struggle, to analyze fascism objectively&#8211;its antecedents, its prime characteristics, and its goals. In denying its ideological importance I am not suggesting that all of its advocates (of the especially early period) were opportunist or deranged individuals reacting to a personal threat to their own situation within the society. A great many of the early fascist intellectuals were responding to a very real social situation. As intelligentsia, keepers of the particular nation&#8217;s system of values, art forms and political thought, they felt it was their responsibility to attempt to resolve a growing social problem. My insistence upon nonimportance of ideology indeed rests squarely upon this point: that most of the fascist intellectuals were reacting to the uprootedness and social disintegration of the particular moment, and with each change in the face of this state of affairs they were in large part forced to repudiate most of their former ideology. Weight is given to this observation by the fact that early fascism included an amalgam of expressionists, anoarcho-syndicalists, futurists, Hegelian idealists, theoretical syndicalists, nationalists and, in the case of the Spanish Falange, intellectual anarchists. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The whole theme of this early face of fascism was not merely anti-communist but fundamentally a general indictment of decadence, bourgeois decadance.<\/p>\n<p><cite>George Jackson, &#8220;Blood In My Eyes&#8221;, pg. 141 &#8211; 142<\/cite>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Removing Emotion From Analysis<\/h3>\n<p>This above quote is taken from George Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Blood In My Eyes&#8221;. It is an opening to a chapter from &#8220;Blood In My Eyes&#8221; entitled, &#8220;Mobilization And Contramobilization&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As stated, this is an opening for one of his more important political analyses of fascism. Comrade Dragon, George Jackson, lays out a fairly general overview here. Later in this chapter, he names names and plots dates to events. I think it is relevant to discuss this overview as it gives a roadmap that can be applied to most times. Most importantly, it can be applied to our times.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I would like to use Comrade George&#8217;s own way of seeing things. In his times, &#8220;fascism&#8221; was not as loosely used as it is in my time zone of USA 2017. In his times, &#8220;communism&#8221; was used in a manner still reeking of McCarthyism. In my time, &#8220;fascism&#8221; is often used interchangeably with &#8220;communism&#8221; or state terrorism. While it lacks nuance and specificity, it hardly needs to borrow any more sensationalism or emotional electricity!!!  Taking Comrade Dragon&#8217;s lead then, I will attempt to adapt his strategy of removing from my own words any ideological loose wires that could cause undue explosions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Intellectual Authority<\/h3>\n<p>Mr. George is discussing a set of conditions we can describe as &#8220;intellectual justification of governments using extreme population control&#8221;. He describes where people of a social system begin to give power over to governments, governing officials, and political figures. He is not indicting &#8220;intellectual people&#8221;. Instead, he is indicting a class of women and men who are tasked with a job of influencing culture through their authority, position, and platforms. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/the-black-state\/president-barry-obeezy-gramscis-afrikan-amerikkkan\/\" target=\"_blank\">This is a similar position held by Antonio Gramsci of a nation&#8217;s intellectual class.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These members of what both Gramsci and Brother George are calling &#8220;intelligentsia&#8221; might today appear on television panels, update Twitter with blue checked accounts, or speak publicly from behind university rostrums. What is being highlighted in this passage is that these people had authority. They were trusted members of society who became desperate to support a movement for social control. In those times that are being spoken of above, all variation of political leanings were seduced. While I do believe Comrade George is being lenient here, given his words, these were well-meaning folk, &#8220;good people&#8221; as we say. Yet, their desire for social order, for decorum, for preservation of positions of authority led to a dangerous political embrace.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Black Media Trust<\/h3>\n<p>This passage above plainly shows exactly why I am constantly discussing <a href=\" http:\/\/www.owlasylum.net\/black-media-trust\/black-media-trust\/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Media Trust<\/a>. US Blacks are a very splintered group who waver often about identity. A drive for acceptance from Whytes and proximity to Whytes complicates our unity and compromises our collective power. As individuals, we must have a system of hopeful scrutinizing of those placed in positions of trust. Even good people with that trust of smart people can lead us into damnation. <\/p>\n","category":"Black Media Trust","author":"J Farand"}]
